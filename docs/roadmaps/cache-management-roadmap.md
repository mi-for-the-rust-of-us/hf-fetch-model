# Cache Management Roadmap

**Date:** March 26, 2026
**Status:** Proposed
**Context:** hf-fetch-model can download, inspect, and search models, but managing the local HuggingFace cache remains manual. Users accumulate tens of GBs across dozens of models and have no way to reclaim space, clean up failed downloads, or even find where a model is stored — short of navigating the opaque `models--org--name` directory structure by hand.

---

## The pain

The HuggingFace cache (`~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`) grows silently. Every `hf-fm <REPO_ID>` adds a `models--org--name/` directory that persists indefinitely. There is no expiry, no size limit, no garbage collection. Users discover the problem when their disk fills up, then face a manual cleanup: figure out which `models--` directories correspond to which repos, guess which ones are safe to delete, and hope they don't break symlinks or leave orphaned refs.

hf-fetch-model already provides *visibility* (`du`, `status`, `list-files --show-cached`) and *integrity checking* infrastructure (`checksum.rs`). What's missing is the ability to **act** — delete, clean, verify, and organize the cache from the CLI.

---

## What Python's `huggingface-cli` provides

Python's `huggingface_hub` CLI offers cache management via `hf cache`:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hf cache ls` | List cached repos with disk usage |
| `hf cache ls --revisions` | List cached revisions per repo |
| `hf cache rm <REVISION_HASH>` | Remove a specific revision by hash |
| `hf cache prune` | Remove unreferenced revisions (detached snapshots with no ref pointing to them) |
| `hf cache verify` | Verify cached file checksums |

The Python CLI was revamped in v1.0/v1.1 (2025–2026, see [#1065](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/issues/1065) and [PR #3439](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/pull/3439)), adding sorting options and improved commands. Some long-standing gaps remain:
- `rm` operates on revision hashes, not human-readable repo IDs
- No `--older-than` age-based eviction
- No `--except` to protect specific repos during bulk cleanup
- No dataset cache scanning ([#2218](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/issues/2218) — open since April 2024)

hf-fetch-model can offer a simpler, repo-ID-based UX with age-based eviction and partial-download cleanup.

---

## Proposed features

### Tier 1 — Essential

#### `hf-fm cache delete <REPO_ID> [--yes]`

The most common operation: remove a specific cached model by its human-readable repo ID. Shows size before deleting, prompts for confirmation unless `--yes` is passed.

```
$ hf-fm cache delete EleutherAI/pythia-1.4b
  EleutherAI/pythia-1.4b  (2.80 GiB, 8 files)
  Delete? [y/N] y
  Deleted. Freed 2.80 GiB.
```

**Why not just `rm -rf`?** The HF cache uses symlinks and ref files. Naive deletion can leave orphaned refs or break other revisions of the same model. `cache delete` removes the entire `models--org--name/` directory cleanly.

**Implementation:** `cache::hf_cache_dir()` + `chunked::repo_folder_name()` to locate the directory, `cache_repo_usage()` for the size preview, `std::fs::remove_dir_all()` for deletion.

#### `hf-fm cache clean-partial`

Remove `.chunked.part` files and incomplete snapshots left by interrupted downloads. Safe and non-destructive to complete downloads.

```
$ hf-fm cache clean-partial
  Found 2 partial downloads:
    google/gemma-2-2b-it: model-00002-of-00002.safetensors.chunked.part  (1.30 GiB)
    meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B: model.safetensors.chunked.part             (0.45 GiB)
  Clean? [y/N] y
  Removed 2 partial files. Freed 1.75 GiB.
```

**Implementation:** Walk the cache directory, identify `.chunked.part` files. The `has_partial` flag in `CachedModelSummary` already detects these at the repo level.

### Tier 2 — Quality of life

#### `hf-fm cache gc --older-than <DAYS>` / `--max-size <SIZE>`

Two eviction strategies — by age or by budget. Users think in either "what haven't I used recently?" or "how much space can I spare?". Inspired by Cargo's `cargo clean gc --max-download-size=1GiB` ([Rust Blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/12/11/cargo-cache-cleaning/)).

**Age-based:** remove models not accessed in N days.
```
$ hf-fm cache gc --older-than 30
  Will remove:
    EleutherAI/pythia-1.4b  (2.80 GiB, last accessed 45 days ago)
    RWKV/RWKV7-Goose-0.1B  (0.21 GiB, last accessed 62 days ago)
  Keep:
    google/gemma-2-2b-it    (5.10 GiB, accessed 2 days ago)
  Proceed? [y/N] y
  Removed 2 repos. Freed 3.01 GiB.
```

**Budget-based:** delete oldest repos until total cache size is under the target.
```
$ hf-fm cache gc --max-size 5GiB
  Cache is 9.31 GiB, target 5.00 GiB — need to free 4.31 GiB.
  Will remove (oldest first):
    RWKV/RWKV7-Goose-0.1B  (0.21 GiB, last accessed 62 days ago)
    EleutherAI/pythia-1.4b  (2.80 GiB, last accessed 45 days ago)
    google/gemma-scope-2b-pt-res  (1.20 GiB, last accessed 30 days ago)
  Proceed? [y/N] y
  Removed 3 repos. Freed 4.21 GiB. Cache now 5.10 GiB.
```

Both strategies can be combined: `--older-than 30 --max-size 20GiB` removes repos older than 30 days *and* trims further if still over budget.

**Flags:** `--yes` (skip prompt), `--except <REPO_ID>` (protect specific repos), `--dry-run` (preview only).

**"Last accessed" heuristic:** Use the most recent modification time among files in the snapshot directory. This is an approximation (the HF cache doesn't track access times explicitly) but matches how `huggingface-cli` determines staleness.

#### `hf-fm cache verify [REPO_ID]`

Re-verify SHA256 checksums of cached files against HF LFS metadata. Detailed design already exists in the [v0.10.0 roadmap](v0.10.0-roadmap.md). Non-destructive, requires network to fetch expected hashes.

### Tier 3 — Scripting and convenience

#### `hf-fm cache path <REPO_ID>`

Print the snapshot directory path for a cached model. Useful for scripting and shell integration.

```
$ hf-fm cache path google/gemma-2-2b-it
/home/user/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--google--gemma-2-2b-it/snapshots/abc1234def5678

$ cd $(hf-fm cache path google/gemma-2-2b-it)
```

**Implementation:** `hf_cache_dir()` + `repo_folder_name()` + `read_ref()` to resolve the snapshot path. Returns non-zero exit code if the repo is not cached.

**Limitation:** resolves the `main` ref only. Repos downloaded at a non-default revision (e.g., `--revision some-branch`) are not resolved. A future `--revision` flag will address this.

**Note:** `cache list` was considered as a separate command but dropped in favor of consolidating all cache visibility into `du` with progressive flags (`--age`, `--tree`). See the [du extensions roadmap](hf-fetch-model-du-extensions-roadmap.md) for details. One command to learn, fewer to remember.

---

## Subcommand grouping

Action commands group under a `cache` subcommand. Visibility stays in `du`:

```
# Seeing (du — one command, progressive flags)
hf-fm du                          # numbered list with partial markers
hf-fm du <N>                      # drill into Nth repo
hf-fm du --age                    # add last-access column
hf-fm du --tree                   # structural view

# Acting (cache — destructive operations)
hf-fm cache delete <REPO_ID|N>
hf-fm cache clean-partial
hf-fm cache gc --older-than 30
hf-fm cache gc --max-size 20GiB
hf-fm cache verify <REPO_ID>
hf-fm cache path <REPO_ID>
```

`du` for **seeing**, `cache` for **acting**. No `cache list` — `du` covers all visibility needs. Inspired by Docker's `docker system df` + `docker system prune` separation.

**Implementation note:** Clap supports nested subcommands via `#[command(subcommand)]` on an enum field. Add a `Cache` variant to `Commands` with its own `CacheCommands` enum.

---

## Relationship to v0.10.0 roadmap

The [v0.10.0 roadmap](v0.10.0-roadmap.md) covers `verify`, `clean` (with `--older-than`, `--repo`, `--all`, `--except`), and `du --tree`. This roadmap extends that vision with:

- **`cache delete`** — simpler single-repo deletion (v0.10.0's `clean --repo` covers this but `cache delete` is more discoverable)
- **`cache clean-partial`** — targeted partial-download cleanup (v0.10.0's `clean` removes entire repos, not individual partial files)
- **`cache gc --max-size`** — budget-based eviction (inspired by Cargo's `cargo clean gc --max-download-size`)
- **`cache path`** — scripting helper (not in v0.10.0)
- **`du` consolidation** — all cache visibility in `du` with `--age` and `--tree` flags, no separate `cache list`
- **Subcommand grouping** — `du` for seeing, `cache` for acting (inspired by Docker's `df` + `prune` separation)

These can be implemented incrementally across releases, starting with `cache delete` and `cache clean-partial` which address the most immediate pain.

---

## Release plan

Incremental delivery across patch and minor releases. Ship the highest-impact features first in small releases, reserve the minor bump for the more complex features that need the "last accessed" heuristic and network-based verification.

### v0.9.2 — CLI ergonomics (dogfooding) ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| Version in `--help` | `hf-fm --help` now shows the version number in the header |
| `--preset pth` | Filter preset for PyTorch `.bin` weight files (`pytorch_model*.bin`) |
| Glob in `download-file` | `hf-fm download-file org/model "pytorch_model-*.bin"` expands globs |
| `--flat` download flag | Copies files to flat `{output-dir}/{filename}` layout after download |

Addresses immediate friction from dogfooding. Ships fast, no architectural changes. **Shipped.**

### v0.9.3 — Immediate pain relief ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `cache delete` | Single-repo deletion by repo ID or numeric index, confirmation prompt, `--yes` flag |
| `cache clean-partial` | Remove `.chunked.part` files from interrupted downloads, `--dry-run`, `--yes` |
| `du` numbered indexing | Add `#` column, accept `du <N>` for drill-down, `●` partial marker, dynamic column width |

Also shipped in v0.9.3 beyond the original plan: gated model pre-flight check, `du` cache path header, `candle_inspect` example, cache layout verification test. **Shipped.**

### v0.9.4 — Scripting and visibility ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `cache path` | Print snapshot directory path for scripting |
| `du --age` | Add last-modified age column to `du` output (replaces the dropped `cache list`) |

Also shipped in v0.9.4 beyond the original plan: `--tag` search flag, binary name fix, em-dash legend, `--exact` help text, search cross-references, algorithmic fixes (targeted cache scans, BTreeSet dedup, filter-before-clone, TiB formatting). **Shipped.**

### v0.9.5 — Library hardening ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| Cache layout centralization | Extract all hf-hub cache path construction (`models--org--name`, `snapshots/`, `refs/`, `blobs/`) into a single `cache_layout.rs` module that delegates to `hf_hub::Repo::folder_name()`, `CacheRepo::pointer_path()`, etc. Replaces ~15 scattered `format!("models--{}", ...)` call sites across `chunked.rs`, `cache.rs`, `download.rs`, and `main.rs`. One file to audit when hf-hub bumps. |
| Watch-based progress channel | Add a `tokio::sync::watch::Receiver<ProgressEvent>` API alongside the existing `Arc<dyn Fn>` callback. Async GUI/TUI consumers can `.changed().await` on the receiver instead of bridging the callback into a channel themselves. The existing callback API stays unchanged (backward compatible). |

Also shipped in v0.9.5 beyond the original plan: 8 audit fixes (chunked download timeout, TCP connect timeout, Windows blob corruption, POSIX symlink TOCTOU race, inspect task cancellation, blocking I/O moved to `spawn_blocking`, CDN URL expiry detection with re-probe, temp file RAII cleanup), shared HTTP client for `list_repo_files_with_metadata`, `parse_header_json` zero-clone iteration, `check_disk_space` cache scan removal. **Shipped.**

### v0.9.6 — Inspect discoverability ✓ ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| Dynamic table column widths | All 12 CLI tables (`inspect`, `diff`, `list-files`, `status`, `du`, `search`, `list-families`, `discover`, `--dry-run`, shard summary, multi-file summary, cache status) compute widths from actual data instead of hardcoded values. Fixes misalignment for long tensor/file names (e.g., multimodal models with `model.vision_tower.encoder.layers.*.mlp.*` prefixes). |
| `inspect --dtypes` | Per-dtype summary (tensor count, params, bytes) instead of individual tensors. Composes with `--filter` for subset breakdowns. |
| `inspect --dtypes --json` | Compact JSON schema (`{ dtypes: [...], total_tensors, total_params }`) for cross-model scripting (e.g., "find all cached models with FP8 tensors"). |
| `inspect --limit N` | Truncates tensor list to first N entries (applied after `--filter`). Solves the "wall of JSON" problem; the `--json` output gains a `truncated: { shown, total }` field so consumers can detect incomplete output. Schema-identical to v0.9.5 when not truncated. |
| `inspect --tree` | Hierarchical view grouped by dotted namespace. Single-child chains merge into one line; numeric sibling groups with structurally-identical sub-trees collapse to `layers.[0..N]   (×K)` with the template shown once. Composes with `--filter` and `--json` (tagged-enum schema: `leaf` / `branch` / `ranged`). Conflicts with `--dtypes` and `--limit` (clap parse-time rejection). |
| Cargo + GitHub description | Updated to reflect inspect/diff scope, not just downloads ("Download, inspect, and compare HuggingFace models from Rust..."). |

**Theme: structural discovery.** The HuggingFace ecosystem has many tools for *aggregating* (param counts, dtype distributions) but few for *exploring* (where do these tensors live? what's the namespace structure?). The `--tree` view in particular surfaces architectural variation (e.g., Gemma 4's per-layer shape differences) that flat listings hide.

Closest prior art: [EricLBuehler/safetensors_explorer](https://github.com/EricLBuehler/safetensors_explorer) — interactive TUI for local files. `hf-fm inspect --tree` differs by being remote-capable (HTTP Range), printable (pasteable into bug reports/comments), explicitly range-collapsing, and integrated with the same toolchain as downloads.

Critical for answering candle ecosystem issues ([#3448](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/issues/3448), [#2875](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/issues/2875)) where users are stuck because they can't see the tensor structure.

### v0.9.7 — Inspect discoverability & newbie-friendly UX ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `inspect --list` | New discovery flag: numbered `.safetensors` table (filename + size) with `Repo:` and `Rev: <commit-sha>` header, alphabetically sorted so shards order naturally. No header parsing. Footer tip advertises the short SHA to pass via `--revision` for reproducibility. Composes with `--cached` (lists local snapshot, immune to remote changes) and `--revision` (locks both `--list` and the follow-up `inspect <n>` to the same commit). |
| `inspect <repo> <n>` numeric index | Bare-integer filenames resolve against the alphabetically-sorted safetensors listing (1-based). Literal filenames unchanged. Transparency line `Resolving index 3 → <name> (repo rev: <short-sha>)` printed to stderr before the inspect proceeds, so users catch mismatches immediately. Out-of-range indices produce a clear error pointing at `--list`. |
| `inspect` clear error on unsupported file types | Dogfooding Gap 1 resolved: passing a non-safetensors file (e.g. `.npz`) now emits `hf-fm inspect supports .safetensors only (got .npz for <path>)` instead of the misleading `failed to parse header JSON: expected value at line 1 column 1`. Driven by a new `FetchError::UnsupportedInspectFormat { filename, extension }` variant; retry classification updated accordingly. |
| `--preset npz` | Dogfooding Gap 3 resolved: new `Preset::Npz` variant plus `Filter::npz()` builder helper. Matches `*.npz`, `*.npy`, `config.yaml`, `*.json`, `*.txt` — tuned to NumPy-based weight repos such as Google's GemmaScope transcoders. Wired into the default download command, `--dry-run`, `list-files`, and `warn_redundant_filters`. |
| Alphabetical `--help` command listing | `hf-fm --help` and `hf-fm cache --help` now list subcommands alphabetically at runtime (via `display_order` re-assignment in `main`). Adding a new command lands in the right place automatically regardless of enum declaration order — no reviewer discipline required. |
| `list-families` line wrapping + cache header | Each repo prints on its own line, indented under the family column (the single run-on line for large families like `llama` is gone). Output now starts with `Cache: <absolute path>`, matching the header style used by `du`. |
| `inspect --help` examples block | `after_help` footer on the `inspect` subcommand with four concrete invocations (inspect-all / --list / index / --tree) plus a note on index stability and `--revision` pinning. Highest-ROI newbie-facing change: visible the moment the user types `--help`. |
| `indicatif` bumped `0.17 → 0.18` | Zero source changes needed — every API we call (`MultiProgress`, `ProgressBar`, `ProgressStyle`) was stable across the bump. Concrete build-tree win: `hf-hub` already pulled in `indicatif 0.18`, so we were compiling it **twice**; now we compile it once. |
| `cargo update` patch bumps | Eleven semver-compatible updates (tokio, openssl, clap, clap_derive, hyper-rustls, typenum, webpki-roots, and others). Routine hygiene. |

**Theme: discoverability + cache visibility.** v0.9.6 shipped structural discovery *inside* a safetensors file (`--tree`, `--dtypes`); v0.9.7 extends the principle *outward* to the repo level — "what can I inspect in this repo?" answered by `--list`, "which cache am I looking at?" answered by the new `Cache:` header on `list-families`, "which commit am I picking from?" answered by `Rev:` on `inspect --list`. The pattern unifies as: **every discovery command announces its scope before showing results**, so the user never has to guess at provenance.

**New public APIs.** Two additions to the library surface, both narrow and documented:

- `hf_fetch_model::repo::list_repo_files_with_commit(repo_id, token, revision, client) → (Vec<RepoFile>, Option<String>)` — same HTTP call as `list_repo_files_with_metadata` but also returns the resolved commit SHA. The existing `list_repo_files_with_metadata` is now a thin wrapper over this, so the seven existing callers in the crate see no breaking change.
- `hf_fetch_model::inspect::list_cached_safetensors(repo_id, revision) → (Vec<(String, u64)>, Option<String>)` — cheap name-and-size enumeration of cached safetensors, paired with the snapshot's commit SHA. Does **not** parse headers (unlike `inspect_repo_safetensors_cached`). Type-aliased as `CachedSafetensorsListing`.

**Known narrow gap surfaced.** Building the `--revision` hardening for `inspect --list` revealed a pre-existing limitation of every `--cached` code path: `cache::read_ref` looks for `refs/<revision>` on disk, which exists for branches/tags (`main`, `v1.0.0`) but **not** for raw commit SHAs — SHAs live in `snapshots/`, not `refs/`. So `--cached --revision <full-sha>` currently prints `Rev: (unknown)` and an empty listing even when the snapshot directory exists on disk. Not a regression — every existing `--cached` path has this limitation; `--list` just made it newly *visible*. ~10-line fix in `cache.rs`, deserves its own PR with tests. Detailed analysis in [`docs/dogfooding-feedbacks/hf-fm-dogfooding.md`](../dogfooding-feedbacks/hf-fm-dogfooding.md) under "Known narrow gap uncovered".

### v0.9.8 — Download durability ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `--timeout-per-file-secs`, `--timeout-total-secs` CLI flags | Plumbs the existing `FetchConfigBuilder::timeout_per_file` / `timeout_total` builder methods through to the CLI. The 300 s default in `download.rs` is unchanged when the flag is omitted; users with slow connections on multi-GiB files can now extend it (e.g. `--timeout-per-file-secs 1800`). Wired through the default download command, `download-file`, and the `download-file` glob path via a shared `apply_timeout_overrides` helper so the per-call-site plumbing is DRY. |
| Partial state preservation on transient interruption | Inverts the `TempFileGuard` policy in `chunked.rs` from "wipe-by-default, `commit()` to keep" to "keep-by-default, `mark_corrupt()` to wipe". The intent split: transient failures (timeout-induced future drop, Ctrl-C, panic, retryable chunk error) leave the `.chunked.part` on disk and survive into the next invocation; confirmed corruption (etag/total-size/schema mismatch) wipes inline. The v0.9.5 RAII intent — clean cleanup of `.chunked.part` on JoinSet abort — is preserved through `mark_corrupt()`. |
| Resume after interruption via `.chunked.part.state` sidecar | New `chunked_state.rs` module storing per-chunk completion offsets as JSON next to the partial. `prepare_or_resume_temp_file` reuses an existing `(.chunked.part, .chunked.part.state)` pair when its `(schema_version, etag, total_size, connections)` quadruple matches the current download — bytes already downloaded are kept and each chunk sends `Range: bytes=<start+completed>-<end>` to skip them. On any invariant mismatch, both files are removed and a fresh state is written. The sidecar is updated atomically (write-tmp + rename) every 16 MiB of per-chunk progress and removed by `finalize_chunked_download` after the blob rename. End-to-end verified on the real Gemma 4 multimodal repo (9.54 GiB) at the slow-connection regime where the v0.9.7 binary was unable to complete. |
| `cache clean-partial` sweeps the new sidecars | `PartialFile::sidecar_paths()` enumerates the `.chunked.part.state` and `.chunked.part.state.tmp` siblings; `run_cache_clean_partial` removes them best-effort alongside the main partial. Without this, the sweep would leave kilobyte-sized orphans. |

**Theme: download durability.** v0.9.5 hardened the TCP/HTTP layer (TCP connect timeout, CDN expiry re-probe, TempFileGuard RAII). v0.9.8 hardens the wall-clock layer above it: configurable per-file and total budgets, preserved partial state on interruption, and resumeable downloads across invocations. The user-visible contract becomes: *if you see bytes on disk, they survive — and the next invocation continues where you left off, as long as the upstream file has not changed*.

**Concrete unblock.** Resolves the slow-connection lockup discovered while answering candle [#3448](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/issues/3448) (Gemma 4): a 9.54 GiB safetensors file at ~7 MiB/s effective throughput is uncompletable under the v0.9.7 CLI's 300 s/file ceiling regardless of retries (each retry truncated the prior partial via `prepare_temp_file`'s `File::create()`). With v0.9.8, `hf-fm download-file google/gemma-4-E2B-it model.safetensors --timeout-per-file-secs 1800` succeeds in one continuous run; if interrupted, the next invocation resumes via the sidecar.

**Test surface.** 119 tests passing (was 117 in v0.9.7, +2 sidecar-paths unit tests, +13 in the new `chunked_state` module, +3 for the TempFileGuard inversion, +3 CLI tests for the new flags, balanced against the 3 existing chunked.rs tests). `clippy --features cli --all-targets -- -D warnings -W clippy::pedantic` is clean — pre-existing `too_many_lines` warnings on six orchestration functions (`run`, `run_download`, `run_diff`, `run_inspect_single`, `run_list_files`, `download_all_files_map`) annotated with `#[allow(clippy::too_many_lines)]` + EXPLICIT reason comments, framed as a deliberate Phase-1-scope decision rather than fragmented refactors of unrelated code paths.

### v0.10.0 — Cache maturity & first docs (in progress)

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `cache verify` ✓ | SHA256 re-verification against HF LFS metadata (requires network). Detailed design in [v0.10.0 roadmap](v0.10.0-roadmap.md). Streaming spinner progress per file (rotating `\| / - \\` ASCII bar via `indicatif`) so multi-GiB safetensors hashes give continuous liveness feedback rather than a long blank pause. |
| `cache gc` ✓ | Age-based (`--older-than`) and budget-based (`--max-size`) eviction, with `--except`, `--dry-run`, `--list-kept`. Active partial downloads (mtime within the last hour) are skipped to avoid racing with `hf-fm download`. |
| `du --tree` ✓ | Tree-view of cache directory structure with box-drawing characters. Reuses the visual style established by `inspect --tree` in v0.9.6 (same `├──`, `└──`, `│   ` connectors and dynamic column-width approach). Each cached repo renders as a branch (size + file count, optional `--age` column, partial-download marker) with its files as leaves sorted by size descending. Composes with `--age`; conflicts at clap parse-time with the positional `du <REPO>` form (the per-repo view is already covered there). |
| Cache fast-path correctness ✓ | `download_all_files_map` previously short-circuited to `Cached` whenever the snapshot directory contained any include-filter-matching file, leading to a misleading "Cached at:" message when only the small config files were on disk and `model.safetensors` was absent. The fast-path now runs *after* the remote file listing and verifies every filtered remote file resolves to a real path under the snapshot dir. Cost: one cheap HTTP listing per `hf-fm <repo>` call when the cache happens to be complete. Discovered while dogfooding v0.9.8; landed on `main` immediately so future `hf-fm <repo>` invocations are correct. |
| Pipe-eats-exit-code FAQ entry ✓ | Wrapping `hf-fm download-file ... 2>&1 \| tail -20` masks hf-fm's exit code with `tail`'s, hiding download failures. New FAQ entry under "Errors and unexpected output" explains the mechanic and gives copy-paste recipes for `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` (bash/zsh) and `$LASTEXITCODE` (PowerShell). Not a code bug — pure documentation — but worth naming because long downloads invite the `\| tail` reflex. |
| **First docs effort** ◐ | **First tutorial shipped: [Inspect before you download](../tutorials/inspect-before-downloading.md) ✓ — establishes `docs/tutorials/` and lands the inspect-without-downloading walkthrough using `zed-industries/zeta-2` as the running example, pinned to a specific SHA for reproducibility, with a closing pivot to bartowski's GGUF Q4_K_M for the "doesn't fit on a 5060 Ti" case. Second tutorial shipped with v0.10.5: [Clean up before your disk fills](../tutorials/clean-up-before-your-disk-fills.md) ✓ — the cache-management capstone of the v0.10 line (`du` → `status` → `cache delete` / `clean-partial` / `gc` / `verify` / `path`, framed as "`du` for seeing, `cache` for acting"), with exact outputs captured from the maintainer's real 592 GiB / 66-repo cache and a dry-run-first safety discipline replacing the SHA-pinning convention (the cache is machine-local, so outputs are illustrative rather than reproducible). First two case studies shipped with v0.10.5 ✓: [`docs/case-studies/`](../case-studies/) lands [per-layer shape variation in Gemma 4](../case-studies/gemma4-per-layer-shape-variation.md) (candle [#3448](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/issues/3448)) and [reconstructing an OOM from a crash log](../case-studies/qwen3-next-memory-forensics.md) (candle [#3530](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/issues/3530)) — written, as planned, *after* the threads settled, and deliberately honest about how far each got ("mitigated success": correct diagnosis posted, loop never closed by the reporter). Still pending: broader workflow tutorial (`search` → `inspect` → `download` → `cache` lifecycle); further case studies as more threads mature. Establishes the habit of shipping docs alongside features.** |

These are more complex than prior releases: verify needs network + checksum comparison, gc needs the last-accessed heuristic and interactive prompt safety, `du --tree` is a display feature that benefits from the `du --age` timestamps added in v0.9.4. The docs effort scopes to the new v0.10.0 cache features plus the first case studies (not a comprehensive rewrite of all existing docs). This is the project's coming-of-age release: where `hf-fetch-model` graduates from "useful tool with `--help`" to "documented, mature tool with narrative onboarding".

The cache fast-path correctness and pipe-FAQ ✓ items above are early increments toward v0.10.0 — UX bugs surfaced during v0.9.8 dogfooding, fixed on `main` immediately rather than waiting for a v0.9.9 patch release. They establish a small precedent: post-release dogfooding gaps land on the next-minor's branch, not the current-patch's. With `cache verify`, `cache gc`, and `du --tree` all marked ✓, the v0.10.0 feature work is complete; only the **First docs effort** remains before the version bump.

### v0.10.1 — `inspect --check-gpu` (hypomnesis adoption) ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `inspect <repo> [FILE] --check-gpu [N]` ✓ | Adds a GPU-fit verdict to `inspect`: model weight size compared against free VRAM on device `N` (default 0). Works on both per-file (`inspect <repo> file.safetensors --check-gpu`) and whole-repo (`inspect <repo> --check-gpu`, forces shard aggregation so the verdict reflects the precise sum of tensor byte-lens across every shard, not the looser file-size proxy). Uses the **unfiltered** model totals (so `--filter` / `--limit` only affect the printed tensor table). On systems with no NVIDIA GPU detected, an out-of-range device index, or where neither NVML nor DXGI is usable, the verdict line reports the failure verbatim and the command still exits 0 — `--check-gpu` is informational, never a gate. |
| `--json` composition ✓ | `gpu_check` JSON object added to the existing per-file schema, the `--tree --json` schema, and the `--dtypes --json` schema (each gated by `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]` so non-`--check-gpu` JSON output stays byte-identical to v0.10.0). The repo-level plain `--json` schema switches from a `Vec<(filename, header)>` array to `{"files": [...], "gpu_check": {...}}` when `--check-gpu` is passed (the array schema is preserved when `--check-gpu` is absent). |
| `hypomnesis = "0.2"` dependency ✓ | Bumped from the originally-planned `"0.1"` to the current crates.io tip; 0.2.0 was released after the v0.10.1 roadmap line was written and is API-additive (`device_info` / `device_count` unchanged). hf-fm v0.10.1 is hypomnesis's **first external consumer** — concrete dogfooding observations captured in [`docs/dogfooding-feedbacks/hypomnesis-adoption.md`](../dogfooding-feedbacks/hypomnesis-adoption.md). |
| `format_size` extracted to `src/format.rs` ✓ | The byte-formatter that has lived in `src/bin/main.rs` since v0.9.4 moves to a binary-internal module (via `#[path = "../format.rs"] mod format;`) so the new `src/gpu_check.rs` verdict renderer can reuse it. Five new unit tests cover the four bucket transitions (B / KiB / MiB / GiB / TiB). No public library API change. |
| Tutorial update ✓ | Tutorial §6 of [Inspect before you download](../tutorials/inspect-before-downloading.md) gains a real `--check-gpu` walkthrough against zeta-2 on an RTX 5060 Ti (verdict: `✗ short by 1.77 GiB` — exact numbers vary run-to-run with other GPU processes, the ✗ is stable). §7's "manual math" paragraph is compressed to a one-liner that points at the verdict already shown in §6. The tutorial's STYLE CONVENTIONS §4 prescribed this change in advance; v0.10.1 closes that forward reference. |

Sample output:

```
$ hf-fm inspect google/gemma-4-E2B-it model.safetensors --check-gpu

  Model weights:  9.54 GiB  (BF16, 5.12B params)
  GPU 0:          NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti — 16.0 GiB VRAM
                  free: 14.2 GiB, used: 1.8 GiB
  Fit:            ✓ 4.66 GiB headroom for weights + KV cache + runtime

  Note: reports weights only. Large-context inference typically needs ~1.3–1.5×
  weight size for KV cache and activations.
```

Validates the `hypomnesis` API surface against a real consumer before `candle-mi` migrates in `hypomnesis` Phase 3 (candle-mi v0.2). Implementation-light on the hf-fm side: read the device info, format the verdict alongside the existing inspect output. The hard work — Windows DXGI per-process VRAM, NVML `u64::MAX` sentinel handling, `nvidia-smi` fallback — lives in `hypomnesis` and is already battle-tested code ported from candle-mi.

**Status:** shipped. `hypomnesis 0.2.0` (the current tip; the originally-planned 0.1.0 was bumped because 0.2 is API-additive over 0.1 and the upstream brief moved on). hf-fm v0.10.1 is the proof-of-concept consumer named in the [hypomnesis brief](https://github.com/mi-for-the-rust-of-us/hypomnesis/blob/main/docs/hypomnesis-brief.md) under *First consumer*. Concrete adoption feedback for the upstream maintainer (us) is captured in [`docs/dogfooding-feedbacks/hypomnesis-adoption.md`](../dogfooding-feedbacks/hypomnesis-adoption.md).

### v0.10.2 — GGUF inspect (cached) + anamnesis dep + hypomnesis 0.2.1 adoption

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `inspect <repo> file.gguf --cached` | Parse GGUF metadata block from locally-cached files. Implementation delegates to `anamnesis::parse_gguf(path).inspect()` — anamnesis is the format-knowledge crate; hf-fm is the HTTP/cache substrate. |
| `--tree` for GGUF | Same hierarchical view, applied to GGUF tensor names. |
| `--dtypes` for GGUF | Same per-dtype summary, applied to GGUF tensors (which use a different dtype encoding than safetensors — needs a small mapping layer). |
| `anamnesis = "0.4.5"` dependency | First adoption of [anamnesis](https://crates.io/crates/anamnesis) — a framework-agnostic Rust crate for parsing tensor formats and dequantising quantised weights. Pulled in here because anamnesis already has a battle-tested GGUF parser; v0.10.3 then extends the dep across the other formats with no further library work. |
| `hypomnesis 0.2 → 0.2.1` + `name_or_unknown()` adoption + `test-helpers` dev-feature | Cashes in the [hypomnesis-adoption.md](../dogfooding-feedbacks/hypomnesis-adoption.md) dogfooding report. Bumps the runtime dep to 0.2.1, replaces the inline `dev.name.as_deref().unwrap_or("unknown GPU")` at [src/gpu_check.rs:200](../../src/gpu_check.rs#L200) with the upstream convenience, and adds `hypomnesis = { version = "0.2.1", features = ["test-helpers"] }` under `[dev-dependencies]` so the `GpuDeviceInfo::builder()` becomes available to tests without leaking into the runtime binary. Writes the two fit-path / miss-path JSON unit tests that the comment block at [src/gpu_check.rs:475-482](../../src/gpu_check.rs#L475-L482) currently defers to manual smoke testing. **Pulled forward from v0.10.4** so the v0.10.1 hypomnesis adoption loop closes in the same patch that opens the anamnesis adoption loop. |
| `diff --dtypes` flag | Side-by-side per-dtype histograms for two repos plus a Δ row showing per-dtype byte/tensor deltas. Refactors `inspect --dtypes`'s aggregator into a shared helper, then renders two columns + a delta column. Composes with `--filter` (histogram aggregates over filtered tensors) and `--summary` (`--dtypes` replaces the per-tensor body; `--dtypes --summary` prints histogram + one-line totals). `--json` gains a `dtype_histograms: { a, b }` field alongside the existing per-tensor diff. **Direct enabler for the candle #3530 p2 reply** — if/when @sempervictus shares the crashing 80B repo and the working 35B sibling, this flag lands the side-by-side dtype evidence that distinguishes "scaled sibling, allocator-side bug" from "architectural variant" in one screenshot. Context: [docs/issues/candle-3530-p1.md](../issues/candle-3530-p1.md). |
| `diff --json` byte-count enrichment + jq recipe | Adds `byte_count: u64` to `DiffTensorSide` ([src/bin/main.rs:3507](../../src/bin/main.rs#L3507)) so a downstream analyzer can sum bytes per pattern bucket from the existing `diff --json` output. Documents a `jq` recipe in [docs/FAQ.md](../FAQ.md) collapsing `model.layers.{N}.*` into one bucket per pattern with a count and a summed byte total. **JSON-first by design**: the recipe is the structured-analysis hook for layer-index collapse; baking a `--collapse` flag into the tool waits on real-world cases informing the right heuristic (numeric-segment abstraction? template grouping? expert-routing-aware?). One-line struct change + a doc paragraph; the bake-in is deferred to v0.11 once two or three real cases land. |

Closes the format-coverage gap with `safetensors_explorer` for cached files. Lower lift than full remote support — local file reading only, leverages existing tree/dtypes infrastructure from v0.9.6. The dominant audience here is `llama.cpp` users who already have GGUF files in their HF cache.

**The dep enters here, not in v0.10.3.** v0.10.2 *needs* a GGUF parser to ship the cached-inspect feature; anamnesis already has one. Bringing it in at v0.10.2 gates v0.10.3's three-format extension on a single, focused dependency commit.

**Ecosystem-adoption release.** Hf-fm's two adjacent co-developed libraries — hypomnesis (GPU substrate, dep since v0.10.1) and anamnesis (format substrate, *new* dep here) — both land properly in one stroke. The release also ships the candle #3530 reply enabler (`diff --dtypes`) and opens the JSON-first analysis hook for future case studies.

**Commit order on the v0.10.2 work branch, smallest to largest, smallest-risk to highest-risk:**

1. **hypomnesis 0.2.1 bump** — `Cargo.toml` runtime + dev-deps lines, [src/gpu_check.rs:200](../../src/gpu_check.rs#L200) call-site swap, two unblocked fit/miss JSON unit tests replacing the deferred-tests comment block. ~15 LOC + tests. Zero new dispatch paths.
2. **`diff` enhancements** — refactor `inspect --dtypes` aggregator into a shared helper; add `--dtypes` flag to `diff` with side-by-side rendering and the `dtype_histograms` JSON field; add `byte_count` to `DiffTensorSide`. ~80 LOC + tests. Additive flag, no behavior change on default `diff`.
3. **jq recipe in [docs/FAQ.md](../FAQ.md)** — a new entry under the Discovery section: "How do I compare two HuggingFace models structurally?" pointing at `diff` / `diff --dtypes` / `diff --json | jq …`. Doc-only.
4. **anamnesis 0.4.5 adoption + GGUF inspect cached + `--tree` / `--dtypes` for GGUF** — new dep, new format, new dispatch path, dtype-mapping layer, adversarial-input caps. The bulk of the release.

The order is insurance — commits 1–3 are small, contained, and ship the candle #3530 enabler. If commit 4 hits an unforeseen GGUF / adversarial-input snag, v0.10.2 can still ship with only commits 1–3 and the GGUF work moves to v0.10.3 without renumbering or backing out.

### v0.10.3 — Cached-file format coverage via anamnesis + GGUF render polish

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `inspect <repo> file.npz --cached` | Parse `.npz` archive metadata via `anamnesis::inspect_npz(path)`. Tensor list, dtypes, shapes — uniform with the other three formats. |
| `inspect <repo> file.pth --cached` | Parse `.pth` (PyTorch state_dict) metadata via `anamnesis::parse_pth(path).inspect()`. Tensor list, dtypes, shapes. |
| Safetensors parser dedup | Replace hf-fm's in-tree JSON header parser with `anamnesis::parse_safetensors_header(&bytes)` on the cache-hit path. hf-fm continues to fetch the bytes; anamnesis owns the format knowledge. |
| Format-aware error message | Lift the `FetchError::UnsupportedInspectFormat` rejection introduced in v0.9.7: `inspect` now dispatches by extension across all four formats (`.safetensors` / `.npz` / `.pth` / `.gguf`) for cached files. |
| Quant-scheme display | `inspect` output gains a `Format: <QuantScheme>` line (FP8 / GPTQ INT4 g=128 / AWQ / BnB-NF4 / etc.) and a "Dequantised: X GB" line, both pulled from `anamnesis::InspectInfo`. |
| `--tree` for GGUF | Extend [`print_tree_summary`](../../src/bin/main.rs) to accept GGUF tensor lists. The renderer is already format-agnostic (it takes `&[TensorInfo]`), so the work is mostly verification: GGUF tensor names use `blk.<N>.<part>` layout instead of safetensors' `model.layers.<N>.<part>`, and the numeric-sibling collapse (`[0..N]`) should already work because it's regex-based. Deferred from v0.10.2 commit 4c after smoke-testing showed it's purely a render-path verification problem, not a parser problem. |
| `--dtypes` for GGUF | Extend [`print_dtype_summary`](../../src/bin/main.rs) for GGUF tensors. Needs a small **dtype-mapping layer** because GGUF dtype names (`Q2_K`, `IQ1_S`, `IQ2_XXS`, `Q4_K_M`, `IQ4_NL`, etc.) don't have entries in `TensorInfo::dtype_bytes()` (which only knows `BOOL` / `U8` / `F16` / `BF16` / etc.). Two paths: (a) extend `dtype_bytes` to handle GGUF block-quant types by recognising the `Q*_*` / `IQ*_*` prefixes and looking up byte sizes from an `anamnesis::parse::gguf::GgufType::type_size()` table; or (b) bypass `dtype_bytes` for the GGUF path and use the per-tensor `byte_len` directly (already populated from anamnesis at parse time, so summing-per-dtype just walks the existing data). Option (b) is the right move — it preserves `dtype_bytes` as a "pure-element-size" helper for plain dtypes and avoids cross-format pollution. The aggregator gets an alternate code path keyed off the format flag. |
| GGUF render polish (3 cosmetic fixes from v0.10.2 commit 4b) | The render path was designed for safetensors's narrow metadata shape and shows three rough edges on GGUF that v0.10.2 documented but deferred: (a) the `Header:` line prints `0 B (JSON), <total> total` because the "(JSON)" suffix is hardcoded — for GGUF, drop the suffix and the leading `0 B`, leaving just `Header: <total> total`; (b) the one-line comma-separated `Metadata:` rendering struggles with 30+ GGUF keys — switch to tabular when keys > 6, sorted/grouped by namespace prefix (`general.` / `<arch>.` / `tokenizer.` / `quantize.`); (c) `tokenizer.chat_template` values are multi-line Jinja templates that wrap awkwardly inline — combined with (b)'s tabular fix, long values get their own indented block automatically. All three live in the same renderer code; bundling them with the `--tree` / `--dtypes` work keeps the GGUF-rendering touch coherent. |

**Theme: cashing in the anamnesis dep, finishing GGUF rendering.** v0.10.2 introduced `anamnesis 0.4.5` as a dependency (the GGUF parser) and shipped basic `inspect <repo> file.gguf --cached` in [commit 4b](../../CHANGELOG.md); v0.10.3 extends that adoption to the other three formats, retires hf-fm's duplicated safetensors header parser, **and finishes the GGUF rendering work deferred from v0.10.2** — `--tree` and `--dtypes` support plus the three cosmetic fixes against the safetensors-flavoured renderer. **No new HTTP work**; mostly dispatch wiring + render-path enhancements. The format-agnostic rename of `SafetensorsHeaderInfo` (a misleading name once the type covers all four formats) lands here too — breaking change is acceptable because the field shape stays identical; consumers just update the type name.

After v0.10.3, `hf-fm inspect <repo> <any-tensor-file> --cached` works uniformly across all four tensor formats anamnesis supports, with all rendering flags (`--list`, `--filter`, `--limit`, `--tree`, `--dtypes`, `--json`) honoured across every format. Sets the stage for v0.11, where the same four formats become inspectable *remotely* via HTTP Range.

**Commit order on the v0.10.3 work branch, smallest to largest, smallest-risk to highest-risk:**

The eight feature-table items above land in three phases. Each phase is independently shippable as v0.10.3 — if a later phase stalls, the remainder defers to v0.10.4 without renumbering or backing out.

**Phase A — Finish v0.10.2-deferred GGUF rendering (no new format scope):**

1. **GGUF render polish (3 cosmetic fixes from v0.10.2 commit 4b)** — pure render-path changes: drop the `(JSON)` suffix + leading `0 B` from the `Header:` line for GGUF; switch the one-line comma-separated `Metadata:` to a tabular block (sorted/grouped by namespace prefix) when keys > 6; render `tokenizer.chat_template`'s multi-line Jinja value as an indented block automatically via the tabular fix. All three live in the same renderer code; bundling preserves coherence. ~50 LOC, no new dispatch paths.

2. **`--tree` for GGUF** — verification + tests that [`print_tree_summary`](../../src/bin/main.rs) handles GGUF's `blk.<N>.<part>` naming the same way it handles safetensors's `model.layers.<N>.<part>`. The numeric-sibling collapse is regex-based and should work as-is. ~10 LOC + fixture-driven tests.

3. **`--dtypes` for GGUF** — the dtype-mapping layer (option (b) per the feature table above: bypass `dtype_bytes` for GGUF and use per-tensor `byte_len` already populated by anamnesis at parse time). [`print_dtype_summary`](../../src/bin/main.rs)'s aggregator gains a format-keyed alternate code path. ~40 LOC + tests.

**Phase B — Extend anamnesis adoption across the remaining three formats:**

4. **Safetensors parser dedup (cache-hit path)** — replace hf-fm's in-tree JSON header parser with `anamnesis::parse_safetensors_header(&bytes)`. Pure refactor — same in/out behavior, existing safetensors fixtures verify identical output. The bespoke remote-inspect `fetch_header_bytes` path stays (retired in v0.11.1). ~30 LOC net negative.

5. **NPZ cached inspect** — new `.npz` dispatch via `anamnesis::inspect_npz(path)`. Anamnesis's NPZ primitive is already shipped in v0.4.3 (the originally-motivating GemmaScope case). New test fixture needed. ~40 LOC + fixture + tests.

6. **PTH cached inspect** — new `.pth` dispatch via `anamnesis::parse_pth(path).inspect()`. PTH parsing is anamnesis's most complex format (pickle VM, adversarial-input caps), but at hf-fm's layer it is just one more dispatch arm. New test fixture needed. ~40 LOC + fixture + tests. **Highest-risk commit** because anamnesis's PTH coverage is the newest of the four — real-world `.pth` files may stress the parser in ways NPZ / GGUF have not.

7. **Format-aware error wording** — lift the `FetchError::UnsupportedInspectFormat` Display message (and the inline dispatch's error path) so the supported set is named explicitly: `.safetensors` / `.npz` / `.pth` / `.gguf` for cached files. Trivial wording-only change; ~5 LOC. Naturally lands after commits 5 + 6 so the wording matches what is actually implemented.

**Phase C — User-facing polish:**

8. **Quant-scheme display** — `inspect` output gains the `Format: <QuantScheme>` and `Dequantised: X GB` lines, both pulled from `anamnesis::InspectInfo`. Benefits from all four formats being inspectable so the field renders uniformly. ~30 LOC.

**Rescue path** (insurance — commits 1–3 ship the deferred v0.10.2 promise on their own):

- If only Phase A lands cleanly: ship v0.10.3 as "GGUF rendering completion". Phases B + C defer to v0.10.4. The GGUF work was the chief deferred-from-v0.10.2 commitment and stands alone.
- If commit 6 (PTH) hits anamnesis-side friction: ship 1–5 + 7 (re-scoped to name only the three formats actually supported in this release) as v0.10.3. PTH + Phase C defer to v0.10.4.
- If commit 8 (quant-scheme) hits unexpected `InspectInfo` API friction: ship 1–7 as v0.10.3 (full four-format `--cached` coverage minus the polish line). Quant-scheme defers to v0.10.4.

### v0.10.4 — `--check-gpu` follow-ups (KV-cache & hybrid-Mamba budgeting)

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `inspect --check-gpu --context N` (transformer KV) | KV-cache budgeting for standard transformer architectures. Computes KV bytes from the model's `num_key_value_heads × head_dim × dtype_bytes × 2 (K+V) × num_hidden_layers × context` against the user-supplied context length, adds it to the weight bytes, and reports a *real* fit verdict instead of the v0.10.1 "weights only" disclaimer. Reads `config.json` from cache / API for the architectural parameters (already on the cache-first path used by `inspect`); falls back to a clear error when the config is missing or doesn't expose the GQA-related keys. Replaces the v0.10.1 closing note (`Note: reports weights only…`) with a `KV cache @ ctx=N: X.YZ GiB` line and a precise `Total: W + KV = X.YZ GiB` rollup. |
| `inspect --check-gpu --context N` (hybrid Mamba + attention) | Same flag, hybrid-architecture branch. When `config.json` flags a hybrid model (Qwen3-Next, Nemotron-H, Jamba family — detected via `model_type` / `architectures` / the presence of Mamba-specific keys like `mamba_d_state`), the budget includes **both** the KV bytes for the attention layers (as above, but counting only `num_attention_layers`, not all layers) **and** the SSM/Mamba state bytes (`mamba_d_state × hidden_size × mamba_expand × num_ssm_layers × dtype_bytes`, approximated per the model's specific SSM variant). Output adds a `Mamba state: X.YZ GiB` line alongside `KV cache: X.YZ GiB` and rolls into `Total: W + KV + Mamba = X.YZ GiB`. **Direct response to the [candle #3530](../issues/candle-3530-p2.md) investigation**: that case identified the bug locus as a KV-allocator cap on Spark / SM121 that doesn't grow into available UMA pages, but only *after* establishing that the model + KV + Mamba state + runtime accounted cleanly for the observed memory pressure. Letting users predict KV + Mamba budgets *before* launching vllm-rs / candle would catch this class of crash at design time instead of inference time. |
| `inspect <repo>` discoverability hint (no FILE) | A bare `inspect <repo>` with no rendering flag resolves to the per-file rollup ([`print_multi_file_summary`](../../src/bin/main.rs)), which prints only `File / Tensors / Params` columns plus the `N files, N tensors, … params` summary — no tensor names, and no nudge toward the per-tensor views that *do* exist (`--tree`, `--dtypes`, a literal `<filename>`, or the v0.9.7 numeric index). Add a one-line footer hint after the summary pointing at those, special-cased for the common single-`.safetensors` repo where the rollup is least informative (one row, a param count, and nothing else). Pure render-path addition; no new dispatch path. **Dogfooding origin:** the mdlm-owt `inspect` session (2026-05-29) — the user landed on the bare rollup (`131 tensors, 169.6M params`), saw no tensor names, and had to already know to append `--tree` or a filename to get per-tensor detail. |
| `inspect` repo-level `Source:` label accuracy | The network repo-inspect path hardcodes `Source: mixed` ([src/bin/main.rs:5643](../../src/bin/main.rs#L5643)) regardless of provenance: the per-file source returned by `inspect_repo_safetensors` is discarded at the `.map(\|(name, info, _source)\| (name, info))` site ([src/bin/main.rs:5624](../../src/bin/main.rs#L5624)), so `mixed` is a constant masquerading as computed state — it prints even when every file was range-fetched remotely. Thread the discarded `_source` through and compute the label honestly: `cached` (all local), `remote` (all range-fetched), or `mixed (N cached, M remote)` for a genuine split. Brings the repo-level header into line with the per-file `inspect`, whose `cached` / `remote (2 HTTP requests)` label ([src/bin/main.rs:5351-5355](../../src/bin/main.rs#L5351)) is already accurate. **Dogfooding origin:** same mdlm-owt session — `Source: mixed` read as opaque, and investigation confirmed it is not even derived from the actual cached/remote mix. |

*(The `GpuDeviceInfo::name_or_unknown()` adoption originally scheduled here was pulled forward to v0.10.2 — see that section.)*

**Theme: extending `--check-gpu` with hybrid-aware memory budgeting.** v0.10.1 shipped single-device, weights-only `--check-gpu`; v0.10.4 spends the hypomnesis dependency on the two features users will ask for once they have used `--check-gpu` on real boxes: transformer KV budgeting at a user-supplied context length, and hybrid-Mamba state budgeting for the Qwen3-Next / Nemotron-H / Jamba class of models. The hybrid branch is motivated by the [candle #3530](../issues/candle-3530-p2.md) case study: predicting the KV + Mamba memory budget *before* a long-context launch is the diagnostic that would have surfaced sempervictus's KV-pool exhaustion at design time. Lands after the anamnesis-driven v0.10.2 / v0.10.3 patches because both KV-cache branches want the same config-aware infrastructure those patches are building (the cache-first `config.json` read in particular).

**Dogfooding polish (secondary thread).** Alongside the `--check-gpu` budgeting work, v0.10.4 picks up two small `inspect`-output fixes surfaced by the mdlm-owt dogfooding session (2026-05-29, full report in [`docs/dogfooding-feedbacks/hf-fm-dogfooding-mdlm-owt-session.md`](../dogfooding-feedbacks/hf-fm-dogfooding-mdlm-owt-session.md)): a discoverability hint on the bare `inspect <repo>` rollup, and an honest repo-level `Source:` label to replace the hardcoded `mixed`. Both are render-path-only, ship independently of the GPU work, and can land first as low-risk warm-up commits if the KV / Mamba branches need more time. The third finding from that session — a `cat`-style stdout view for small text files — is **not** added here: it is already the v0.11.4 `peek` feature (below), which this session independently corroborates.

**Out of scope for v0.10.4 (still deferred):** Multi-GPU `--check-gpu all` and the multi-context "fit profile" sweep — both lifted into v0.12.0 below, where they ship together as the *"matrix verdicts"* family; AMD ROCm support (waits on hypomnesis's `rocm-smi` backend, planned in hypomnesis 0.3); Apple Metal (likewise, future hypomnesis backend); `--print-arch` flag surfacing the full `config.json` architectural-parameters block (one for users who want to do the KV / Mamba math by hand or sanity-check hf-fm's numbers — natural v0.10.5 follow-on once the cache-first config read lands); `diff-config <REPO_A> <REPO_B>` for architectural comparison between scaled-sibling pairs (v0.11 scope, complements `diff --dtypes`). All are reasonable later-release extensions.

### v0.10.5 — `inspect --pick` (interactive file selection) ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `inspect <repo> [FILE] --pick` ✓ | Interactive numbered picker for `inspect`'s file argument. With no positional, lists every supported tensor file in the repo (`.safetensors` / `.gguf` / `.npz` / `.pth` — multi-format from day one, inheriting v0.10.3's dispatcher). With a positional substring, narrows the listing first: if exactly one file matches, auto-runs against that file (printing `Resolving to: <name>` on stderr for transparency); if several match, prints a numbered table and prompts for selection. Composes with every existing rendering flag (`--dtypes`, `--tree`, `--filter`, `--limit`, `--check-gpu`, `--json`). Conflicts with `--list` at clap parse time — `--list` is the non-interactive form of the same listing, combining them is incoherent. |
| TTY safety + cancellation ✓ | Pre-flight check on `stdin.is_terminal() && stderr.is_terminal()` (stdout intentionally not checked — the prompt goes to stderr, so `hf-fm inspect ... --pick > out.json` works correctly with the picker on the terminal and JSON to the file). Non-interactive contexts (CI logs, piped stdin, captured stderr) get a clear error pointing at the existing `--list` + numeric-index workflow. Ctrl-C exits with the standard interrupt code; Ctrl-D / empty input bails with `cancelled — no file picked` and a non-zero exit code. Invalid input (`"foo"`, out-of-range integer, zero) loops the prompt without crashing. |
| FAQ entry ✓ | The *Discovery — finding what to inspect or download* section in [`docs/FAQ.md`](../FAQ.md) gains a third sub-question on file selection: *"A repo has many `.safetensors` files — can I pick one interactively?"* — pointing at `--pick` alongside the v0.9.7 `--list` + numeric-index path. The two coexist: power users continue running `inspect <repo> --list` then `inspect <repo> 3`; impatient users (and the maintainer) reach for `--pick`. |
| `--timeout-total-secs` hard wall-clock enforcement (dogfooding fix) ✓ | Surfaced 2026-06-12 while staging interrupted downloads for the cache tutorial: the overall budget was only a between-files check and was ignored entirely by `download-file`, so a single dominant file ran to `--timeout-per-file-secs` (300 s). Both paths now bound the in-flight download by the total budget (`timeout_at` deadline / `bound_by_total_timeout`); effective cap is `min(per-file, remaining-total)`. Verified live; three `start_paused` virtual-time tests. |
| `inspect` gated-repo diagnosis on 401/403 (dogfooding fix) ✓ | Surfaced 2026-06-12 while provisioning the Goodfire geometric-calculator replication: `inspect meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B --check-gpu` died with the raw `Range request for model-00002-of-00004.safetensors returned status 403 Forbidden`, although `download` has had a gated pre-flight since v0.9.3 — and `list-files` *deepens* the trap because the Hub serves gated repos' metadata (sizes, SHA256s) publicly, so everything looks accessible until the first content byte. Fix: on a `returned status 401/403` inspect error, one best-effort `fetch_model_card` probe; if the repo is gated, the raw error becomes a `FetchError::Auth` with the license URL and token guidance (no-token vs token-rejected wording, the latter noting that each gated family is licensed separately — a Llama 3.2 grant does not cover Llama 3.1). Binary-side only; probe failures fall back to the original error. Verified live against the originating repo. Sibling fix in the same release: `diff` issues the same Range requests against two repos — each side's fetch is wrapped separately with the shared helper (`enrich_gated_content_error`), so the diagnosis names exactly which repo is gated. |
| `status` per-file partial attribution (dogfooding fix) ✓ | Surfaced mid-download of `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct` ([report](../dogfooding-feedbacks/hf-fm-dogfooding-status-partial-misattribution.md), 2026-06-10): `repo_status`'s `else if has_any_partial` arm is repo-level, so during any active download every absent file prints `Partial` with the *same* size (the first `.chunked.part` found by `find_partial_blob_size`), and preset-`Excluded` / genuinely-`Missing` files are swallowed by the short-circuit before their arms are reached. Fix: a **per-file** lookup keyed on `RepoFile.sha256` → `blobs/<sha256>.chunked.part` (the data is already in hand — the chunked path writes `<etag=sha256>.chunked.part`), falling through to the existing `Excluded` / `Missing` arms when a file has no chunk of its own. Reporting-only (the transfer finalizes correctly); blast radius is the `status` display, **not** the `du` GC, which keys off the separate repo-level `CachedModelSummary.has_partial` flag and stays correct — so `repo_has_partial` stays in place. |

**Theme: discovery UX for the long-filename case.** v0.9.7 added `--list` + numeric-index resolution for the same problem, but at the cost of a two-step workflow. `--pick` collapses that to one keystroke for unique matches and one numeric choice for ambiguous ones — and inherits format coverage from v0.10.3's multi-format dispatcher, so the picker works uniformly across `.safetensors`, `.gguf`, `.npz`, and `.pth` from its first release. No new library API, no new dependencies — `std::io::IsTerminal` is already in scope from other CLI paths, and the candidate-narrowing logic reuses the listing helper introduced in v0.9.7. ~80 LOC in `src/bin/main.rs`; candidate-narrowing is pure and unit-testable; the prompt loop itself gets a manual smoke test per shell.

**Concrete dogfooding origin.** Surfaced from the typed-the-full-filename pain documented in candle [#3448](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/issues/3448) (gemma-4-E2B-it's `model.safetensors` typed in full to inspect `--filter embed`) and candle [#2875](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/issues/2875) (demoncore-flux's `transformer/demonCORESFWNSFW_fluxV13.safetensors` — 50 characters of exact filename to get the dtype histogram). The fix is mechanical once you've felt the pain twice.

**Out of scope for v0.10.5 (deferred):**

- **Shell tab completion** (clap_complete-generated bash / zsh / fish / PowerShell scripts with a dynamic callback into `hf-fm inspect <repo> --list`). Native TAB behavior would be nicer than typing a substring, but each shell needs its own integration, dynamic completions on TAB feel slow when they trigger an HTTP listing, and the cross-shell maintenance burden is minor-release scope, not patch. Revisit for v0.11 if user demand surfaces.
- **Multi-selection.** One file per `inspect` invocation, same as today. Users who want all files run `inspect <repo>` (aggregated); users who want a subset can run the command twice. Multi-selection would force the rendering pipeline to handle a `Vec<picked>` instead of a single filename — a deeper refactor that exceeds the patch's UX-only ambition.
- **Fuzzy matching beyond substring** (Levenshtein, prefix-completion via lookahead, etc.). Substring is the cheapest contract that says what the user means: *"the filename contains these characters"*. Stronger matchers expand the surface for "did you mean" confusion that the explicit picker already solves.

**Status: shipped (all four table rows).** One design decision went beyond the table: rather than giving `--pick` a private multi-format listing, the **whole listing universe was unified** — `inspect --list` and the v0.9.7 numeric index now also cover `.safetensors` / `.gguf` / `.npz` / `.pth`, so `#N` means the same file in `--list`, `inspect <repo> <n>`, and the picker (one additive library helper, `inspect::list_cached_tensor_files`, plus the shared `is_supported_tensor_file` predicate). Two further contracts fixed at implementation time: under `--pick` the positional is **always** a substring (never a numeric index — the picker is the selection mechanism), and the substring match is **case-insensitive**.

### v0.10.6 — Dogfooding polish & onboarding ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| README onboarding: intention-based tutorial callout ✓ | The above-the-fold "New to hf-fm?" callout pointed only at the inspect tutorial; the v0.10.5 cache tutorial existed but lived solely in the Documentation table, so a newcomer hitting the top of the README never saw it. Reworked into a two-bullet **"I want to…"** intention list — *"I want to know which model to download"* → [Inspect before you download](../tutorials/inspect-before-downloading.md), *"I want to manage the models on my disk"* → [Clean up before your disk fills](../tutorials/clean-up-before-your-disk-fills.md) — lifecycle-ordered (choose → manage), with the FAQ / CLI-reference pointers kept below. Both tutorials now surface at the same tier. Doc-only; [README.md:24](../../README.md#L24). Intention-list framing was chosen over a skill-level split (the commands are different *jobs*, not beginner-vs-advanced) and held at two bullets to match the two shipped tutorials, leaving an obvious slot for a future "downloading efficiently" line. |
| Filtered repo-level `inspect` lists matched tensor names (dogfooding fix) ✓ | `hf-fm inspect <repo> --filter X` with no `FILE` and no aggregation flag prints only a per-**file** match *count*, never the matched tensor names — so the common "what's in block N?" question takes a second command against a specific shard. Both repo-rollup renderers will list the matched names when `filter.is_some()`: [`print_shard_index_summary`](../../src/bin/main.rs) reads them straight from `index.weight_map` ([src/inspect.rs:253](../../src/inspect.rs#L253)) with **no header reads** (the loop at [src/bin/main.rs:6493-6502](../../src/bin/main.rs#L6493) already binds each name, then discards it for a counter), and [`print_multi_file_summary`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L6695) lists them from the `info.tensors` it already walks. Names only — shapes / dtypes / sizes still need header reads, so the per-file `Hint:` stays. Report: [`inspect-filtered-repo-level-names.md`](../dogfooding-feedbacks/inspect-filtered-repo-level-names.md) Symptom 1. |
| `--json` honored on the shard-index fast path (dogfooding fix) ✓ | Contract bug: on a **sharded** repo, `inspect <repo> --filter X --json` (no aggregation flag) returns early through `print_shard_index_summary` — which takes no `json` parameter — and **silently prints the human rollup instead of JSON** ([src/bin/main.rs:5917-5923](../../src/bin/main.rs#L5917-L5923) returns before the `if json` branch), breaking any `jq` pipeline. `--json` must always emit JSON: thread `json` into the shard path and emit a JSON shard-summary (`{ files: [...], weight_map_matches: [...] }`) built from the index, preserving the no-header-read cheapness. Narrow scope (sharded repo + `--filter` / no-`FILE` + no aggregation) is why it survived to now; higher severity than Symptom 1 because it fails *silently*. Report: same doc, Symptom 2. |
| Case-insensitive `inspect` / `diff` `--filter` ✓ | v0.10.5 made `--pick`'s substring matching case-insensitive, but `--filter` everywhere is still case-sensitive `name.contains(pattern)` ([src/bin/main.rs:6495](../../src/bin/main.rs#L6495) plus ~7 sibling call sites in inspect/diff), so `--filter "Layers.0"` silently matches nothing for a user who internalised the `--pick` contract. Centralize into one `matches_filter` helper and align `--filter` to the same case-insensitive substring contract. **Behavior change** — it only *widens* matches, so it is vanishingly unlikely to break a consumer; flagged under CHANGELOG `Changed`. Rides the names-listing edit, which already touches these functions. |
| Unified per-tensor-detail hint wording ✓ | The two repo-rollup renderers print materially different nudges for the same situation: the terse `Hint: use hf-fm inspect <repo> <filename> for per-tensor detail` ([src/bin/main.rs:6548](../../src/bin/main.rs#L6548)) vs the richer "this rollup hides tensor names — run … `--tree` (or `--dtypes`)" ([src/bin/main.rs:6786](../../src/bin/main.rs#L6786)). Unify on the richer wording so a sharded vs non-sharded repo gives the same-quality hint. Lands in the same edit as the names-listing fix. |
| `list-files` pluralization fix ✓ | `run_list_files`'s summary footer hardcodes the word `files`, so a single-match repo prints `1 files, 3.68 GiB total` ([src/bin/main.rs:7111](../../src/bin/main.rs#L7111), [:7115](../../src/bin/main.rs#L7115)) — the lone holdout among the binary's rollups, every other of which already routes through the `pluralize()` helper two screens up in the same file. Two-line fix; no test asserts the current string. |
| `FetchError::Auth` doc-comment corrected ✓ | The variant's rustdoc still says *"Reserved for future use… auth failures surface as `FetchError::Api`"* ([src/error.rs:35-37](../../src/error.rs#L35)), but `lib.rs` actively constructs `Auth` for gated-repo scenarios ([src/lib.rs:277](../../src/lib.rs#L277), [:299](../../src/lib.rs#L299)) and `retry.rs:106` treats it as a real, non-retryable variant. Stale public-API doc that misleads library consumers (candle-mi, anamnesis) into thinking they cannot pattern-match on `Auth`, and contradicts [src/lib.rs:214](../../src/lib.rs#L214) which documents the gated path correctly. Replace with the actual gated-repo semantics (no token, or token rejected on 401/403). Doc-comment only. |
| Doc clarifications ✓ | Cheap correctness sweep across the reference docs: (a) document `--filter` as case-**in**sensitive (clap help [src/bin/main.rs:444](../../src/bin/main.rs#L444) and [cli-reference.md](../cli-reference.md)) — done with the case-insensitive filter change; (b) add the `du` `●` partial-marker legend to [cli-reference.md](../cli-reference.md) (it is legended in the README but was absent from the reference — `--show-cached`'s `✓`/`✗` glyphs were already documented there); (c) narrow the README `status` row's "complete / partial / missing / excluded" wording to note that four-state vocabulary is the per-repo `status <REPO_ID>` view — the all-repos table prints only `ok` / `PARTIAL` ([src/bin/main.rs:2334](../../src/bin/main.rs#L2334)). |
| `anamnesis` `0.6.5` → `0.6.7` (security) ✓ | Picks up anamnesis Phase 6.11 (pickle-VM) + 6.12 (vendored-ZIP) parser hardening, which protects hf-fm's `inspect --cached` PTH / NPZ paths — the `inspect_pth_cached` / `inspect_npz_cached` parsers hand untrusted on-disk files to anamnesis on every cached inspect. Inert for hf-fm's metadata-only usage (it never calls `remember` / dequant); the `inspect_cached_*` integration suite passes unchanged. 6.12 also drops the external `zip` crate (anamnesis now vendors ZIP handling), trimming four transitive deps (`zip`, `arbitrary`, `crossbeam-utils`, `derive_arbitrary`). Continues the v0.10 supply-chain-hygiene theme; this is the bump flagged as pending after v0.10.5. |

**Theme: dogfooding polish & onboarding.** No new feature surface — v0.10.6 is a grab-bag patch of small UX and correctness fixes, most surfaced by dogfooding, bundled because they are individually trivial and collectively raise the floor. The spine is the **`inspect --filter` repo-level** pair (names listed + `--json` honored), which closes the one genuine contract bug (silent non-JSON) the v0.10 line shipped; the case-insensitive `--filter` alignment and the hint-wording unification ride the same renderer edits. Around it sit two one-edit correctness fixes (the `1 files` pluralization, the `FetchError::Auth` doc-comment), the intention-based README onboarding callout, and a doc-clarification sweep. Everything is additive except the case-insensitive `--filter` widening, flagged under CHANGELOG `Changed`.

These items were surfaced by a thorough three-axis project assessment (docs/UX, code-quality, CLI-ergonomics) run 2026-06-14, which confirmed the codebase carries essentially no tech debt (zero TODO/FIXME markers, SPDX headers complete, all binary `unwrap`/`expect` confined to `#[cfg(test)]`) — so the patch is deliberately small and high-confidence. Larger ideas the assessment raised but deferred as minor-release-shaped: `list-files --json` / `du --json` (`--json` coverage parity), `diff --limit` (parity with `inspect --limit`), `download-file --dry-run`, and a "reclaimed bytes" totals line on `cache gc` / `cache delete`.

**Commit order (smallest / lowest-risk first):**

1. **README onboarding callout** ✓ — doc-only, already on `main`.
2. **`list-files` pluralization** — 2-line `pluralize()` swap.
3. **`FetchError::Auth` doc-comment** — rustdoc-only public-API correctness.
4. **Doc clarifications** — reference-doc legends + `status` cell scoping.
5. **`inspect --filter` names + `--json` + case-insensitive + unified hint** — the one code-heavy commit, all within the two rollup renderers; lands with new unit tests (matched-names listing for both the shard-index and multi-file paths, the JSON shard-summary shape, and case-insensitive matching).

### v0.10.7 — CLI parity & scriptability (shipped 2026-06-21, closes the v0.10 line)

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| ✅ `list-files --json` | `list-files` carries the richest scriptable payload in the tool (filename, size, SHA256, cache status) yet is the **only** "list remote facts" command with no `--json`, while `inspect` / `diff` / `info` all have it — so the natural pre-download scripting hook (size budgeting, checksum-manifest generation) currently forces parsing of the aligned human table. Add `--json` to [`Commands::ListFiles`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L488) and its handler; the row data is already collected, so the work is serialising the existing per-file struct. Binary-side only. |
| ✅ `du --json` + `status --json` | The two cache-introspection commands most likely to feed cron / CI — *"am I over budget?"* (`du`) and *"is this repo complete?"* (`status`) — print only human tables, while the adjacent `cache verify` is already documented as CI-composable. Add `--json` to [`Commands::Du`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L357) ([`run_du`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L2396) / [`run_du_repo`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L2493)) and [`Commands::Status`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L299) ([`run_status_all`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L2311) / [`run_status`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L6793)). The per-repo size / file-count struct ([`RepoDiskUsage`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L2600)) and the per-file `FileStatus` already hold everything the JSON needs; the work is serialisation, not new computation. Shipped together so the two never re-create the parity gap that motivated this release. Binary-side only. |
| ✅ `diff --limit N` | `diff` prints the **entire** only-A / only-B / differ bodies with no cap ([`run_diff`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L3791) section loops at [src/bin/main.rs:3904-3957](../../src/bin/main.rs#L3904)) — hundreds of rows on the README's own scaled-sibling example (`gpt-oss-20b` vs `120b`). `inspect` already solved exactly this with `--limit`; `diff`'s per-tensor body is the conspicuous sibling missing it. Add `--limit N` to [`Commands::Diff`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L320), applied per-section after `--filter`, and carry the same `truncated: { shown, total }` field into `diff --json` that `inspect --json` gained in v0.9.6 so consumers detect incomplete output. Additive. |
| ✅ `download-file --dry-run` | [cli-reference.md:470](../cli-reference.md) explicitly notes `download-file` does **not** take `--dry-run`, unlike the default `download` command — so for a glob (`"pytorch_model-*.bin"`) the user cannot preview which files / how many bytes will be pulled before committing the transfer. Add `--dry-run` to [`Commands::DownloadFile`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L244) and route [`run_download_file`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L1391) / the glob path [`run_download_file_glob`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L1507) to the existing [`run_dry_run`](../../src/bin/main.rs#L1256) per-file to-download renderer instead of downloading. Reuses the default command's dry-run table verbatim — parity of the safety flag, not new rendering. Additive. |
| ❌ ~~Reclaimed-bytes totals line on `cache gc` / `cache delete`~~ **(dropped — not a real gap)** | Investigation found the accounting already exists: `run_cache_gc` prints `Removed N repos. Freed X.` (and the dry-run preview prints `Cache: A → B (free X)`), and `run_cache_delete` prints `Deleted. Freed X.`. The original premise ("mutation handlers print per-repo removals with no rollup") was stale, so this item was dropped rather than restyle existing output to a different word. |

**Theme: CLI parity & scriptability — and the v0.10 line's closer.** Where v0.10.6 raised the floor with polish and one contract-bug fix, v0.10.7 makes the **surface uniform**: every item closes a gap where a flag exists on one command but is conspicuously absent on a sibling (`--json` on `list-files` / `du` / `status`, `--limit` on `diff`, `--dry-run` on `download-file`), plus a totals-row consistency fix on the `cache` mutations. The throughline is *scripts should not have to special-case which command supports what* — the read commands (`list-files`, `du`, `status`, `diff`) all become `jq`-pipeable, and the action commands (`download-file`, `cache gc/delete`) all gain the preview / accounting their siblings already have. This is deliberately the last v0.10.x patch: it spends the release on consistency rather than new reach, so the v0.10 line ends with a uniform CLI before v0.11 pivots to remote inspection.

**No new public library API.** All six additions are binary-side only — new `--json` paths serialise structs that already exist (`RepoDiskUsage`, `FileStatus`, the `list-files` row, the diff sides), `--limit` / `--dry-run` reuse existing renderers, and the reclaimed-bytes line reads the existing plan total. candle-mi and anamnesis are untouched, keeping the patch cleanly additive.

**Scope note.** This is a *working* patch — roughly five ~half-day items rather than v0.10.6's hours — but it stays patch-appropriate by the project's cadence (the v0.9.x patches routinely added whole flags), and the binary-only blast radius keeps the risk low.

**Commit order (smallest / lowest-risk first) — status as of 2026-06-21:**

1. ❌ ~~**Reclaimed-bytes totals line**~~ — **dropped**: the accounting already exists (see the struck row above), so this was a non-gap, not work.
2. ✅ **`download-file --dry-run`** (`373963d`) — synthesises a `filter=[filename]` config and reuses `run_dry_run`'s table via an extracted `render_download_plan` helper; tailored header, explicit-miss errors / glob-miss exits 0.
3. ✅ **`list-files --json`** (`6cbba39`) — serialises the per-file row + a typed `FileCacheState` enum (glyph for humans, word for JSON); shipped ahead of `diff --limit` (swapped 3↔4 for strict risk-ascending).
4. ✅ **`diff --limit N`** (`1149d3e`) — per-section `.take(N)` after `--filter`, summary keeps true counts, `truncated {only_a,only_b,differ}` (each `{shown,total}`) in `--json`.
5. ✅ **`du --json` + `status --json`** (`21551b4`) — `du`: flat, `--tree` (nested files per repo), and `<repo>` drill-down; `status`: all-repos + per-repo (per-file `state`). Shared `emit_json` / `system_time_to_unix` / `file_status_json_fields` helpers. **(closes the v0.10 line)**

**Bonus (not originally planned):**
- ✅ **`test(json)`** (`c1c4d9b`) — replaced the smoke/substring `--json` assertions (and the absent `diff`/`info` ones) with real `serde_json`-parse-based schema + invariant tests across every `--json` output; added `serde_json` to dev-dependencies. Surfaced while building item 2's tests.
- ✅ **`refactor(json)`** (`d2db0df`) — cross-item consistency pass: unified the four items' JSON printers on `emit_json`, restored `run_list_files`' doc summary (lost in item 2), and fixed a publish-blocking rustdoc link (`download_plan`) caught by `cargo doc -D warnings`.

**Status: 4 of 4 features shipped (1 dropped as a non-gap); the v0.10 `--json` parity set is complete. Pending before tagging v0.10.7: rename CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` → `[0.10.7]`, bump `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock`.**

Each commit is independently shippable: if a later one stalls, the remainder still constitutes a coherent parity release and the holdout defers to a follow-up without renumbering.

---

The v0.11 minor is dedicated to **remote inspection**. v0.11.0 builds an `HttpRangeReader: Read + Seek` adapter once over `reqwest` Range requests; each subsequent patch wires one more tensor format through the same adapter. anamnesis owns format knowledge; hf-fm owns HTTP plumbing. Format order is risk-ascending: NPZ (anamnesis primitive already shipped in v0.4.3) → safetensors (anamnesis primitive already shipped in v0.4.4, pure hf-fm wiring, retires the bespoke parser) → GGUF (medium library work, the originally-promised v0.11.0 feature) → PTH (largest library work, lowest demand). v0.11.4 then generalises the substrate **beyond the tensor-format matrix** — `peek` reuses `HttpRangeReader` for arbitrary small text / config / `.gz`-compressed sidecar files (`config.yaml`, `README.md`, `index.json.gz`), with no anamnesis dispatch.

### v0.11.0 — Remote inspect framework + NPZ remote ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `HttpRangeReader: Read + Seek` adapter ✓ | New [`src/http_range.rs`](../../src/http_range.rs) module on top of `reqwest` Range requests: 64 KiB tail prefetch (the ZIP EOCD scan + central directory cost one request), 4 KiB read-ahead coalescing, cached extents never re-fetched, `reqwest` errors translated into `std::io::Error` with the typed `FetchError` recoverable afterwards (`take_last_error` — keeps the gated-repo 401/403 diagnosis alive through anamnesis). Beyond the planned scope: **hard safety budgets** (256 requests / 32 MiB per reader, overridable via `with_limits`) so an adversarial archive can never degenerate into a full download, per-response validation (206-only with the body unread on a 200, `Content-Range` match, streamed body cap, cross-request `ETag` consistency), and a transport-agnostic `RangeReader<F: RangeFetcher>` split so the buffering/budget/`Seek` logic is fully unit-tested offline (15 tests, incl. an end-to-end where `anamnesis::inspect_npz_from_reader` parses a hand-built stored-entry NPZ through the reader). The reusable substrate for every subsequent remote-inspect format. |
| `inspect <repo> file.npz` (no `--cached`) ✓ | NPZ dispatch wired to `anamnesis::inspect_npz_from_reader(&mut reader)` on a `spawn_blocking` thread (public API stays async; the reader bridges via `Handle::block_on`). Live-verified against the motivating GemmaScope case: a 72.04 MiB uncached `embedding/width_4k/average_l0_111/params.npz` inspected in **6 range requests / 136.0 KiB fetched**, reported honestly on the `Source:` line (`remote (6 range requests, 136.0 KiB fetched)` — new `RangeStats` type). Cache-first like safetensors; every rendering flag (`--tree` / `--dtypes` / `--filter` / `--limit` / `--json` / `--check-gpu`) and the `--list` / numeric-index / `--pick` flows compose unchanged. |
| Bespoke `fetch_header_bytes` retained ✓ | hf-fm's existing safetensors remote-inspect path stays on its bespoke two-Range-request implementation (`Source: remote (2 HTTP requests)` label unchanged). v0.11.1 retires it. |

**Why NPZ first.** The anamnesis primitive is the only one already shipped — v0.11.0's risk concentrates on the new adapter (the genuinely new piece). NPZ also closes the original candle-mi GemmaScope dogfooding loop that motivated anamnesis's v0.4.3 work: the v0.11.0 ship makes that real end-to-end.

**Status: shipped.** One design decision was overturned by reality mid-implementation: the plan was *probe once, then issue all range requests directly against the signed CDN URL with a token-free client*. The first live run 403'd on every range — **Xet-backed repos sign each CDN URL for the exact `Range` header that minted it** (a `ByteRange`/`ExpectedHeader` condition inside the signed-URL policy), so a URL minted by the `bytes=0-0` probe can never serve any other range. The fix is the pattern the bespoke safetensors path has used all along: each range request targets the HF `/resolve` URL and follows the redirect to a freshly-signed CDN URL (`reqwest` strips `Authorization` on the cross-host redirect, so the token still never reaches the CDN). The fetcher *shrank* — stored CDN URL, `X-Amz-Expires` tracking, and the one-shot re-probe are all unnecessary under per-request re-resolution. **Follow-up confirmed and fixed in-release:** the chunked *download* path stored `RangeInfo::cdn_url` from its `bytes=0-0` probe and issued every chunk request against it — live-tested against the same Xet repo (forced via `--chunk-threshold-mib 10`), **all chunks 403'd with no fallback**: chunked downloads of Xet-backed files ≥ the 100 MiB default threshold were hard-broken. Fixed the same way as inspect (chunk requests re-resolve through `/resolve`, one fresh signature per chunk), removing the now-moot v0.9.5 `X-Amz-Expires` pre-check / re-probe machinery in the same stroke; the failing command then completed at full multi-connection speed (72.04 MiB, 4 connections, 6.0 s, SHA256-verified). Recent large downloads had succeeded only because those repos were not yet Xet-migrated. Also shipped: anamnesis `0.6.7 → 0.6.9`, hypomnesis `0.2.3 → 0.2.5` (spilling detection; verdict-side adoption deferred), and the `.gguf` / `.pth` remote rejection now names each format's actual release (v0.11.2 / v0.11.3).

### v0.11.1 — Remote safetensors via anamnesis ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| Retire hf-fm's bespoke `fetch_header_bytes` ✓ | Feed `HttpRangeReader` (v0.11.0, already `Read + Seek`) directly into `anamnesis::parse_safetensors_header_from_reader<R: Read>` — the two types are already compatible, no adapter needed. Deletes hf-fm's manual two-Range-request fetch (length prefix + header bytes) and its hand-rolled JSON parsing entirely; `src/inspect.rs`'s `fetch_header_bytes` goes away. |
| `Header:` line polish for NPZ / PTH ✓ | Cosmetic nit spotted during v0.11.0 dogfooding: remote **and** cached NPZ print `Header: 0 B (JSON), <total> total` — the `0 B (JSON)` prefix is a safetensors-ism (v0.10.3's render polish dropped it for GGUF only). Extend the same fix to NPZ / PTH: these formats have no discrete header, so render just `Header: <total> total` (or relabel the line `Size:`). Render-path only, ~10 LOC in `format_header_line`. |

**No anamnesis library work required.** The plan originally called for a new ~30 LOC reader-based primitive in anamnesis; `parse_safetensors_header_from_reader<R: Read>` turns out to have already shipped in anamnesis 0.4.4 (2026-05-02), months before this phase — hf-fm's existing `anamnesis = "0.6.9"` dependency already includes it. This phase is now pure hf-fm-side wiring: smaller than originally scoped, and safe to do immediately since it depends on nothing beyond what's already in tree.

**User-facing:** no behavioural change on safetensors — `hf-fm inspect <repo> file.safetensors` works identically; NPZ / PTH lose a misleading `0 B (JSON)` prefix. **Architecturally:** single source of truth for safetensors layout — remote and cached paths both go through the same anamnesis primitive. The duplicated parser is gone.

**Status: shipped.** Landed exactly as scoped above, plus one API consequence discovered during implementation: `inspect::inspect_safetensors`'s return type grew a third `Option<RangeStats>` tuple element (matching `inspect_npz`'s v0.11.0 shape) so the `Source:` line could report honest transfer stats instead of the old hardcoded `remote (2 HTTP requests)` string — verified safe (no downstream consumer calls the function directly). The cache-hit and remote paths were further unified behind a new private `safetensors_header_to_info` mapping so quant detection (`Format:`/`Size:` lines) now works identically whether the file came from cache or network — previously cached-only. Live-verified against real repos, not just synthetic tests: `hf-internal-testing/tiny-random-gpt2` reads as `Source: remote (4 range requests, 8.0 KiB fetched)` (2 of those are the substrate's fixed one-time access probe, shared with every format on this reader; the rest fetch the length prefix and header, one or two depending on header size relative to the reader's 4 KiB read-ahead window), and the NPZ/PTH `Header:` fix was confirmed live against a cached `google/gemma-scope-2b-pt-res` `.npz`.

### v0.11.2 — Remote GGUF inspect ✓

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `parse_gguf_front_matter_from_reader<R: Read + Seek>` (anamnesis library work) ✓ | Not the originally-scoped `Read + Seek` refactor — that had already shipped in anamnesis 0.4.5 as `inspect_gguf_from_reader` (see "Design detour" below). Instead: a new public `GgufFrontMatter` type + `parse_gguf_front_matter_from_reader(_with_limits)` pair, exposing the full per-tensor list and metadata table (not just the aggregate summary) over any `Read + Seek` source, via the same internal `read_gguf_structure` core. Adversarial-input guards from the existing parser (caps on tensor count, KV count, string length, array length, nesting depth, dimension count, element product) carry over unchanged — no new parsing logic. Shipped as anamnesis `0.7.2`. |
| `inspect <repo> file.gguf` (no `--cached`) ✓ | GGUF dispatch wired through `HttpRangeReader` (`inspect::inspect_gguf`, mirroring `inspect_npz` / `inspect_safetensors`'s cache-first shape). `inspect_gguf_cached` and the new remote path share one `gguf_front_matter_to_header_info` mapping function. |

**The originally-promised v0.11.0 feature, now landing on a battle-tested adapter.** A 2 GiB quantised GGUF inspectable in a few range requests fetching the front-loaded metadata block + tensor info table — no weight data downloaded.

**Design detour: summary-only vs. full parity.** Investigation found the roadmap's assumed anamnesis work — refactoring `parse_gguf`'s cursor off `memmap2::Mmap` — had already shipped in anamnesis 0.4.5, well before the pinned `0.6.9`, as `inspect_gguf_from_reader<R: Read + Seek> -> GgufInspectInfo`. But `GgufInspectInfo` is deliberately summary-only (version/arch/tensor_count/total_bytes/distinct-dtypes/alignment) — no per-tensor name/shape/offset list, unlike `NpzInspectInfo` / `SafetensorsHeader` (remote NPZ/safetensors, both full tensor tables) and unlike `ParsedGguf` (cached GGUF). Wiring remote GGUF on top of it alone would have made `--tree` / `--dtypes` / `--filter` / the per-tensor listing silently degrade for GGUF specifically — the one format not at parity with its cached and sibling-remote counterparts. Asked the user; decided on full parity. anamnesis's `read_gguf_structure` internal core already computed everything needed (full tensor-info table + metadata, without touching tensor data) — it just hadn't been exposed publicly in that shape, so the fix was a small, additive anamnesis API surface, not new parsing logic. Shipped as anamnesis `0.7.2`, jumping the version queue ahead of the already-drafted (and separately unrelated) `v0.7.1` — GGUF-reader dequant parallelisation — which remains queued untouched in anamnesis's `ROADMAP.md`.

**Status: shipped.** `inspect::inspect_gguf` follows `inspect_npz` / `inspect_safetensors`'s exact shape: cache-first via `resolve_cached_path`, then `HttpRangeReader::open` + `spawn_blocking` running `anamnesis::parse_gguf_front_matter_from_reader` on the reader, with the typed transport error preferred over the parse error on failure (keeps the gated-repo 401/403 diagnosis alive). `run_inspect_single`'s remote-rejection gate now only covers `.pth`; the `.gguf` half of the old combined rejection test (`tests/cli.rs`) was removed and the PTH half kept (renamed `inspect_remote_pth_errors_names_its_release`). Verified offline (no live-network integration test in `cargo test`, matching the existing NPZ/safetensors precedent): a new `src/http_range.rs` unit test (`gguf_front_matter_over_range_reader_reads_metadata_not_data`) hand-builds a minimal 2-tensor synthetic GGUF with a 600 KiB dummy data section and confirms the front-matter parse completes in **exactly 1 range request, 64 KiB fetched** — well under a quarter of the payload, and bounded by the reader's internal 64 KiB `BufReader` capacity rather than the file size. **Live-verified against a real repo** (manual smoke test, not a `cargo test` target): `bartowski/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct-GGUF`'s uncached `SmolLM2-135M-Instruct-IQ3_XS.gguf` (84.12 MiB, 272 tensors, `Q3`/`Q4`/`Q8`-mixed quantization) reads as `Source: remote (30 range requests, 1.75 MiB fetched)` — 1.75 MiB of 84.12 MiB, 2% of the file — with `--tree` (namespace-collapsed `blk.[0..29].` view) and `--dtypes` (per-dtype histogram: `IQ4_NL`/`F32`/`IQ3_S`/`Q8_0`) both rendering identically to the cached path, confirming full tensor-table parity end to end. On the anamnesis side: 5 new unit tests (`front_matter_from_reader_*`, mirroring the existing `inspect_from_reader_*` family), a new `fuzz_gguf_front_matter` target, and a new `bench_gguf_front_matter` CodSpeed benchmark alongside the existing `bench_gguf_inspect` (same synthetic fixture) — guarding the full-tensor-list path against a regression the summary-only benchmark wouldn't catch.

### v0.11.3 — Remote PTH inspect

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `inspect_pth_from_reader<R: Read + Seek>` (anamnesis library work) | Largest of the four library lifts. PTH's metadata lives in `data.pkl` mid-archive; the existing pickle VM zero-copies from `memmap2::Mmap`. Reader-based path materialises `data.pkl` (typically <100 KiB) via the ZIP central directory, then runs the existing pickle interpreter on that buffer — no zero-copy contract change for the local-file path. |
| `inspect <repo> file.pth` (no `--cached`) | Wire the PTH dispatch path through `HttpRangeReader`. |

**Closes the matrix.** Every tensor format anamnesis supports is now remotely inspectable via the same `HttpRangeReader` substrate. After v0.11.3, `hf-fm inspect <repo> <any-tensor-file>` works uniformly — cached or remote, regardless of format.

### v0.11.4 — `hf-fm peek` (arbitrary small-file fetch, no anamnesis dispatch)

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `hf-fm peek <repo> <file> [--head N \| --tail N] [--bytes] [--gunzip \| --no-gunzip] [--max <SIZE>]` | Small-file inspection **outside the tensor-format matrix**. Reuses the v0.11.0 `HttpRangeReader` substrate to fetch up to a configurable cap (default `--max 10MiB`) of any file in the repo and stream it to stdout. **No anamnesis dispatch** — peek is format-agnostic and explicitly does not parse tensor headers (use `inspect` for that). With no `--head` / `--tail` flag, behaves like `cat` over the substrate — stream up to the cap and stop. |
| `--head N` / `--tail N` (default: lines) | Standard POSIX-style line counts; `--bytes` switches to byte counts. `--head` is cheap (sequential read until N newlines or N bytes); `--tail` issues a Range request from the end (`--bytes`) or chunked end-scan reading ~4 KiB blocks backward until N newlines are seen (`--lines`, the default). Worst-case bounded by the file's longest-line length. |
| `--gunzip` / `--no-gunzip` | Transparent gzip decoding via `flate2::read::GzDecoder<HttpRangeReader>`. Default ON when the URL ends in `.gz`; can be forced via the explicit flag or disabled with `--no-gunzip`. Streaming decoder integrates with `--head` (decode-and-count) but **not** with `--tail` (gzip is sequential; the combination errors at clap parse time pointing at the alternative of `peek file.gz --gunzip --max <SIZE>` followed by `\| tail`). |
| `--max <SIZE>` size cap | The footgun guard — accidentally peeking `model.safetensors` with no flags is rejected with a clear error pointing at `inspect` for tensor formats and at raising `--max` for genuine large-text cases. Default 10 MiB keeps `peek` honest. |
| `--cached` not provided | Peek is remote-only by design. The cached equivalent is `cat $(hf-fm cache path <repo>)/<file>` (or `Get-Content` on PowerShell); adding a `--cached` flag would duplicate that pattern with worse ergonomics. |

Sample sessions:

```
$ hf-fm peek bluelightai/clt-qwen3-1.7b-base-20k config.yaml
features_per_layer: 20480
num_layers: 28
base_model: Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B-Base
quant: bf16
activation: jump_relu

$ hf-fm peek bluelightai/clt-qwen3-1.7b-base-20k features/index.json.gz --gunzip --head 5 --bytes
{"version":"1.0","format":"variable_chunks","0":{"filename":"layer_0.bin","offsets":[0,15
[truncated at --head 5 bytes shown above; pass --max <SIZE> to read more, then pipe through jq]
```

**Theme: generalising the v0.11.x remote-inspect substrate beyond tensor formats.** v0.11.0–v0.11.3 wired the four anamnesis-supported tensor formats through `HttpRangeReader`; v0.11.4 reuses the same adapter for **everything else** — `config.yaml`, `README.md`, `index.json.gz`, license texts, generation configs, and any small text/JSON sidecar a repo ships. No new library work in anamnesis (peek deliberately does not invoke any parser); the entire feature is hf-fm-side HTTP plumbing on top of the existing adapter.

**Concrete dogfooding origin.** Surfaced during the candle-mi v0.1.11 / COLM 2026 rebuttal investigation: needed to peek at `bluelightai/clt-qwen3-1.7b-base-20k`'s `features/index.json.gz` (a 2.33 MiB gzipped JSON sidecar containing per-feature top-token offsets used by the `circuit-tracer` dashboard) to decide whether the BlueLightAI CLT vocabulary scan could bypass running Qwen3 forward passes through candle-mi's transformer arm. `inspect` rejected the file (correct — it's not a tensor format); `download-file --output-dir <cache>` worked but persisted a non-standard cache copy. `peek <repo> features/index.json.gz --gunzip` would have answered the question in one command with no cache pollution. A second, independent dogfooding session (mdlm-owt, 2026-05-29) corroborates the same gap from the opposite direction: `download-file` writes small config / modeling-source files to disk only to be `Read` back, with no stdout dump for the common inspect-before-build case — precisely what `peek` provides.

**Out of scope for v0.11.4 (deferred):**

- **Binary file rendering.** Output for non-text formats is garbage and the tool does not hexdump. `inspect` covers tensor formats; arbitrary binary peek would need its own subcommand.
- **Search / grep semantics.** `peek <repo> <file> --gunzip \| rg pattern` is the composition; baking grep into peek expands the surface for "did you mean to use ripgrep?" confusion.
- **Cached file path.** Already covered by `cat $(hf-fm cache path <repo>)/<file>` (see `--cached` row above).
- **Range across multiple files.** Single-file scope. Multi-file scans are `hf-fm list-files` + a shell loop.

~50 LOC + tests on top of v0.11.0's `HttpRangeReader`. `flate2` is the only new candidate direct dep; first check whether it's already transitively present via `reqwest` (for `Content-Encoding: gzip`) or `zip` (the `.zip` decompression path used by NPZ / PTH) before adding it explicitly. If transitive, no Cargo.toml change beyond the new subcommand wiring.

### v0.12.0 — Multi-GPU + multi-context `--check-gpu` matrix

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `inspect --check-gpu all` | Multi-GPU verdict. Iterates over `hypomnesis::device_count()`, prints one `GPU N:` line per visible device with its own free/used numbers, and picks the device with the most free VRAM for the `Fit:` summary line. The `all` token is parsed via clap's `value_parser`: a bare `--check-gpu` keeps the v0.10.1 single-device default, `--check-gpu N` keeps single-device targeting, `--check-gpu all` enables the iteration. JSON path gains a `devices: [...]` array under `gpu_check` and the existing `device` key becomes an alias for the auto-picked entry. Closes the "I have a 5060 Ti and a 5050 in the same box" case without breaking the v0.10.1 single-device default. |
| `inspect --check-gpu --context-sweep` | Multi-context fit-profile sweep. Prints a table of `Total = W + KV [+ Mamba]` and Fit verdicts at a representative set of context lengths (e.g. 4 K / 16 K / 64 K / 128 K) instead of a single context number. Composes with `--check-gpu N` and `--check-gpu all`, so the matrix can be one-GPU-many-contexts or many-GPUs-many-contexts. Reuses v0.10.4's KV + Mamba budgeting math at each cell. Natural companion to `--check-gpu all` — both are *"show me a matrix of verdicts"* — which is why they ship together. |
| `inspect --check-gpu --processes` (hypomnesis `0.2.2` `PDH` backend) | Itemize the device's `used:` VRAM by process, so the verdict answers not just *"will it fit?"* but *"what do I need to close first?"*. The single-line `free: X, used: Y` becomes a short per-process breakdown (`ollama.exe 4.2 GiB`, `Code.exe 0.8 GiB`, …). Built on `hypomnesis::gpu_processes()`, whose Windows/`WDDM` per-process path landed in **hypomnesis 0.2.2** via the new `PDH` backend (reads the same `VidMm` data as Task Manager's *Dedicated GPU memory* column). hf-fm stayed on `0.2.1` through v0.10.x because `--check-gpu` only uses `device_info` (device-level totals) — the per-process backend was unused weight. This feature is the reason to finally bump: it turns the consumer-GPU "I have 2.76 GiB used and don't know by what" gap into an answer. |

| `inspect --check-gpu` gated-repo estimated verdict | When the header Range request hits a gated repo's 401/403, fall back to the **public** file listing (gated repos' metadata — sizes, SHA256s — is public; only content is gated) and emit an *estimated* weights-only verdict from the summed `.safetensors` file sizes (file size ≈ weights + a few-KiB header; on Llama-3.1-8B the estimate and the header-precise figure are both 14.96 GiB). Output labels the provenance explicitly: `Fit (estimated from public file sizes — header-precise verdict needs the accepted license): ✗ short by 2.2 GiB`. `--context` cannot compose (a gated repo's `config.json` content is itself gated), so the estimate stays weights-only and says so. **Dogfooding origin (2026-06-12):** the "why must I accept a license before knowing whether the model even fits my GPU?" complaint while provisioning the Goodfire geometric-calculator replication; the session workaround — inspect a byte-identical ungated mirror, verified by matching LFS SHA256s — is documented in the FAQ's gated-model entry. This feature makes the workaround unnecessary for the weights question. Placed here because it extends the same `--check-gpu` verdict family, but small enough to pull forward into a v0.10.x patch if demand surfaces: the public listing is already fetched by `list-files`, and the 401/403 detection hook shipped in v0.10.5. |

**Hypomnesis bump 0.2.1 → 0.2.3 — taken early in v0.10.5 (2026-06-12).** The original plan (below, kept for the record) was to hold at `0.2.1` until the v0.12.x `--check-gpu --processes` work, on the reasoning that 0.2.2's Windows `PDH` per-process backend was unused weight for a `device_info`-only consumer. That reasoning held for 0.2.2 — but **0.2.3 adds first-class macOS / Apple Silicon support, including the device-wide VRAM budget via `MTLDevice.recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize`, which is precisely the `device_info` figure `--check-gpu` reads.** That turns `inspect --check-gpu` from "no GPU detected" into a real fit verdict on a Mac — a `device_info` win the deferral never contemplated, so the bump was pulled forward. Cost on the hf-fm side was one line (`gpu_check.rs` `friendly_error` now handles the `HypomnesisError::Pdh` variant explicitly, satisfying `wildcard_enum_match_arm`); the new `objc2` / `objc2-metal` deps are `cfg(target_os = "macos")`-gated, so Linux/Windows builds are byte-identical. The per-process `gpu_processes()` path (PDH / Metal compute-process listing) remains unused until `--check-gpu --processes` lands in v0.12.x — that feature still drives the *next* hypomnesis interaction, just not the version pin.

> *Original deferral note (superseded by the 0.2.3 adoption above):* Through the v0.10.x `--check-gpu` line hf-fm pins `hypomnesis = "0.2.1"`: the KV/Mamba budgeting work reads only `device_info` (device-level total/free/used), which 0.2.2 does not change, while 0.2.2's headline addition — the Windows `PDH` per-process-VRAM backend for `gpu_processes()` — would compile unused into the binary. The bump's natural home is the v0.12.x GPU-reach line. Until then, pinning 0.2.1 keeps hf-fm's build free of a backend it does not exercise.

**Theme: broaden `--check-gpu` from a single verdict to a matrix.** v0.10.1 introduced single-device, weights-only `--check-gpu`; v0.10.4 added KV-cache and hybrid-Mamba budgeting at a user-supplied context. v0.12.0 closes out the family: instead of one device × one context giving one verdict, the user can ask for all devices × a context-length sweep and read off a table. Deferred to v0.12.0 because both features want real multi-GPU hardware to validate (the iteration ordering, the auto-pick heuristic, and the per-GPU sweep all need an actual second device on the box).

**Why v0.12 and not v0.11.x.** The v0.11 line is dedicated to remote-inspect framework work (`HttpRangeReader` + format coverage). Stitching multi-GPU into v0.11 would dilute that focus; saving it for a fresh minor keeps the v0.11 → v0.12 boundary clean: *v0.11 = format reach, v0.12 = GPU reach*.

**Hardware prerequisite.** Maintainer's box gains a second GPU (5050 8GiB alongside the 5060 Ti 16GiB) before this lands — the multi-GPU iteration ordering, the auto-pick heuristic, and the per-device sweep numbers all want a real second device to be exercised against, not a mock.

#### Reference — RTX 5050 8 GB in PCIEX2 on the B550 GAMING X V2

> Compatibility analysis verifying that the **Hardware prerequisite** above is feasible: can a second NVIDIA GPU (specifically an RTX 5050 8 GB) be added to the maintainer's existing system (B550 GAMING X V2 + RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB) in the PCIEX2 slot? Conducted 2026-05-19; source: GIGABYTE *B550 GAMING X V2 User's Manual* rev. 1301, §1-2 *Product Specifications* (p. 6), §1-5 *Installing an Expansion Card* (p. 10), and motherboard layout (p. 4).

**Verdict.** The slot will physically and electrically accept the RTX 5050 8 GB, with three qualifications: PCIe 3.0 ×2 wiring (one-sixteenth the card's native bandwidth), physical clearance below the primary GPU must be verified, and the slot delivers only 75 W (rest from PSU).

**Slot spec — verbatim from the manual** (§1-2, p. 6):

> *"1 x PCI Express x16 slot (PCIEX2), integrated in the Chipset: Supporting PCIe 3.0 x2 mode"*

| Attribute | Value | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| Physical connector | x16 (full-length) | Any PCIe card width (x1/x2/x4/x8/x16) fits mechanically. |
| Electrical lanes | x2 (only 2 of 16 wired) | Card runs in compatibility mode at 2-lane width regardless of native width. |
| PCIe generation | 3.0 | Card auto-negotiates down from its native generation (PCIe 5.0 on Blackwell). |
| Lane source | Chipset (AMD B550), not CPU | Routes via the B550 chipset → CPU link (PCIe 4.0 ×4 on Ryzen 5000), shared with M.2 SB, SATA, other chipset slots/USB. |

**Compatibility — three dimensions.**

1. *Electrical / PCIe protocol — fully compatible.* PCIe is backward-compatible across generations and width-down-negotiable. RTX 5050 (PCIe 5.0 ×8 native) in this slot runs as PCIe 3.0 ×2 effective ≈ 1.97 GB/s peak unidirectional. Nothing in the manual prohibits or restricts which GPU goes here.

2. *Physical clearance — verify against the primary GPU.* Motherboard layout (manual p. 4) shows slot order top-to-bottom: `PCIEX16 → PCIEX1_1 → PCIEX1_2 → PCIEX2 → PCIEX1_3`. PCIEX2 sits ~3 slot pitches (≈ 6 cm) below PCIEX16. The risk is the existing 5060 Ti's cooler shroud overhanging the PCIEX2 area:

   | 5060 Ti slot width | Vertical occupation | Clearance to PCIEX2 |
   |---|---|---|
   | 2 slots | ~40 mm | ~20 mm headroom ✓ |
   | 2.5 slots | ~50 mm | ~10 mm headroom ✓ |
   | 3 slots | ~60 mm | Marginal — verify with calipers |
   | 3.5+ slots | ~70+ mm | Blocked ✗ |

   RTX 5050 8 GB is almost universally a 2-slot card, so it fits *into* PCIEX2 without issue; the only open question is whether the primary 5060 Ti's cooler overhangs it.

3. *Power.* The slot supplies the standard PCIe 75 W. RTX 5050 8 GB TDP ≈ 130 W → needs an external 8-pin (or 6+2) PCIe power cable from the PSU. The 850 W PSU has ample cables.

**Performance implications for the v0.12.0 pipeline-parallel use case.** For PP-style serving where the second GPU receives intermediate activations across a layer boundary:

| Operation | Data per event | Time at PCIe 3.0 ×2 (~2 GB/s) | Acceptable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| One-time model load (~6 GiB worth of weights to Cuda(1)) | 6 GiB | ~3 s | ✓ once per session |
| Prefill: per-layer-boundary activation transfer (seq=2048, hidden=4096, BF16) | 16 MiB | ~8 ms | ✓ |
| Incremental decode: per-layer-boundary transfer (seq=1) | 8 KiB | ~4 µs | ✓ trivial |
| KV cache transfer (KV lives on each layer's device — no cross-device transfer required) | n/a | n/a | n/a |

For autoregressive inference the PCIe 3.0 ×2 wiring is fine. Prefill on long sequences incurs ~8 ms per layer boundary (≈ 16 ms per token in an 18/14 split with both forward boundaries); decode is bandwidth-trivial.

**Two things the manual doesn't address but are worth knowing.**

1. *Chipset-link contention.* All chipset PCIe traffic shares one PCIe 4.0 ×4 link to the CPU (≈ 8 GB/s aggregate). Heavy concurrent M.2 SSD reads + GPU on PCIEX2 + USB traffic could in principle contend; for inference workloads this won't bite — 2 GB/s GPU + ≈ 1 GB/s M.2 reads at startup is well under the ceiling.
2. *No BIOS configuration required.* §1 and §2 of the manual mention no disabling or sharing of PCIEX2 lanes. The slot is hardwired ×2 from the chipset regardless of which other slots are populated. Both GPUs will appear in `nvidia-smi` and in `hypomnesis::device_count()` automatically — which is exactly what `inspect --check-gpu all` needs.

**Conclusion.** Hardware plan is viable for the v0.12.0 work. Only material risk before purchase is **physical clearance with the existing 5060 Ti's cooler** — measure first. PSU, power delivery, BIOS, and chipset routing are all fine.

### `inspect` pickle-safety verdict — candidate (post-v0.12, gated on anamnesis)

Surfaced by the June 2026 [Rust-ecosystem survey](../rust-ecosystem-comparison.md) (the `llm_hunter` entry): no Rust tool gives an *offline, load-safety* verdict on a PyTorch `.pth`, and the one forensic tool adjacent to the space explicitly disclaims pickle-opcode analysis. anamnesis already understands pickle safety — its `.pth` parser enforces a strict GLOBAL allowlist (weights-only-equivalent) and the v0.6.6 pickle-VM hardening means a crafted file can't DoS the parser. The only missing piece is *surfacing* it.

| Feature | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `inspect <repo> file.pth --cached` safety line | After the tensor table, print a pickle-safety verdict from anamnesis's GLOBAL scan: `Pickle: N globals, all tensor-reconstruction (safe to load)` or `⚠ references os.system / posix — arbitrary-code-execution risk under torch.load(weights_only=False)`. `--json` gains a `pickle_safety` object (`globals` / `disallowed` / `verdict`). Binary-side rendering only — no new library API on hf-fm's side. |
| Gated on anamnesis | Needs anamnesis to expose a *non-failing* enumerate-globals scan (today it fails closed on the first disallowed global). Tracked under anamnesis [ROADMAP → Future Directions](../../../anamnesis/ROADMAP.md) ("Pickle GLOBAL safety scan"). Until then hf-fm only gets pass/fail (parse succeeds → safe; parse errors → unsafe-or-malformed) without the itemised list. |

**Why it fits, and where it stops.** It extends "inspect before you download" to "is it safe to *load*" — on-mission, leveraging capability already built, and differentiated from candle's own pickle reader (no allowlist, no signal). Deliberately a *thin surface over what the parser already knows* — **not** a malware-DB scanner or entropy/forensic profiler (that is `llm_hunter` / `modelscan`'s lane, consciously passed on). Prior art exists (`picklescan`, Protect AI `modelscan`, HuggingFace's server-side upload scanning), so the value is the **offline, Rust-native CLI verdict** for consumers outside the Python tooling path (e.g. a candle-mi pipeline), not novelty.

**Provisional placement:** a small v0.12.x patch or the v0.13 opener once the anamnesis scan API lands; the version is deliberately unassigned until then.
